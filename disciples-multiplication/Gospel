What is the gospel?
The gospel means good news. 

Brokenness: We are in a broken world. You can see this is true. Just watch the news, or look around and you might see people fighting, going to war, and you'll hear of terrible things people do. 

God's Heart: God didn't intend for the world to be this way. In the beginning he created the world perfect. He did a wonderful job and he created two people and they had eternal life. There was no death, decay, sadness, or stealing. There was God's perfect design. God gave the people 1 rule. They could not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and if they would they would truly die. The people decided to break that rule and they ended up having knowledge of good, and EVIL. That is why the world now is full of evil. There used to not exist any evil thoughts. The evil of this world started and entered in through the sin that the first humans caused and we suffer with the consequences of this today. We also have evil thoughts, make evil decisions, and partner with those who do the same. OFten in our culture it is celebrated to do things like lose your virginity, or get away with stealing, but these things aren't funny. These are doing things apart from God's perfect design, and they lead to more brokenness. 

Sin: Imagine there was a backpack on your back and all that you've done and said that is evil in that backpack, how heavy would it be? That bag is your sin. It keeps you from eternal life with GOD. It must be removed. The problem is that we deserve to die for our sin. God said if we turned away from him it leads to death, once in this life, and again being sent to the lake of fire apart from God if we die in our sin and never turn to GOd. 
Jesus Solution: How do we turn away from our sins back to GOD?
