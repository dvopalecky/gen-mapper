		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.



  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.



		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/adodbapi/readme.txt
Project
-------
adodbapi

A Python DB-API 2.0 (PEP-249) module that makes it easy to use Microsoft ADO 
for connecting with databases and other data sources
using either CPython or IronPython.

Home page: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/adodbapi>

Features:
* 100% DB-API 2.0 (PEP-249) compliant (including most extensions and recommendations).
* Includes pyunit testcases that describe how to use the module.  
* Fully implemented in Python. -- runs in Python 2.5+ Python 3.0+ and IronPython 2.6+
* Licensed under the LGPL license, which means that it can be used freely even in commercial programs subject to certain restrictions. 
* The user can choose between paramstyles: 'qmark' 'named' 'format' 'pyformat' 'dynamic'
* Supports data retrieval by column name e.g.:
  for row in myCurser.execute("select name,age from students"):
     print("Student", row.name, "is", row.age, "years old.")
* Supports user-definable system-to-Python data conversion functions (selected by ADO data type, or by column)

Prerequisites:
* C Python 2.7 or 3.5 or higher
 and pywin32 (Mark Hammond's python for windows extensions.)
or
 Iron Python 2.7 or higher.  (works in IPy2.0 for all data types except BUFFER)

Installation:
* (C-Python on Windows): Install pywin32 ("pip install pywin32") which includes adodbapi.
* (IronPython on Windows): Download adodbapi from http://sf.net/projects/adodbapi.  Unpack the zip.
     Open a command window as an administrator. CD to the folder containing the unzipped files.
     Run "setup.py install" using the IronPython of your choice.

NOTE: ...........
If you do not like the new default operation of returning Numeric columns as decimal.Decimal,
you can select other options by the user defined conversion feature. 
Try:
        adodbapi.apibase.variantConversions[adodbapi.ado_consts.adNumeric] = adodbapi.apibase.cvtString
or:
        adodbapi.apibase.variantConversions[adodbapi.ado_consts.adNumeric] = adodbapi.apibase.cvtFloat
or:
        adodbapi.apibase.variantConversions[adodbapi.ado_consts.adNumeric] = write_your_own_convertion_function
		............
notes for 2.6.2:
    The definitive source has been moved to https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/tree/master/adodbapi.
    Remote has proven too hard to configure and test with Pyro4. I am moving it to unsupported status
    until I can change to a different connection method.
whats new in version 2.6
   A cursor.prepare() method and support for prepared SQL statements.
   Lots of refactoring, especially of the Remote and Server modules (still to be treated as Beta code).
   The quick start document 'quick_reference.odt' will export as a nice-looking pdf.
   Added paramstyles 'pyformat' and 'dynamic'. If your 'paramstyle' is 'named' you _must_ pass a dictionary of
      parameters to your .execute() method. If your 'paramstyle' is 'format' 'pyformat' or 'dynamic', you _may_
      pass a dictionary of parameters -- provided your SQL operation string is formatted correctly.

whats new in version 2.5
   Remote module: (works on Linux!) allows a Windows computer to serve ADO databases via PyRO
   Server module: PyRO server for ADO.  Run using a command like= C:>python -m adodbapi.server
   (server has simple connection string macros: is64bit, getuser, sql_provider, auto_security)
   Brief documentation included.  See adodbapi/examples folder adodbapi.rtf
   New connection method conn.get_table_names() --> list of names of tables in database

   Vastly refactored. Data conversion things have been moved to the new adodbapi.apibase module.
   Many former module-level attributes are now class attributes. (Should be more thread-safe)
   Connection objects are now context managers for transactions and will commit or rollback.
   Cursor objects are context managers and will automatically close themselves.
   Autocommit can be switched on and off.
   Keyword and positional arguments on the connect() method work as documented in PEP 249.
   Keyword arguments from the connect call can be formatted into the connection string.
   New keyword arguments defined, such as: autocommit, paramstyle, remote_proxy, remote_port.
  *** Breaking change: variantConversion lookups are simplified: the following will raise KeyError:
         oldconverter=adodbapi.variantConversions[adodbapi.adoStringTypes]
      Refactor as: oldconverter=adodbapi.variantConversions[adodbapi.adoStringTypes[0]]

The source code for the PyDev.Debugger files are provided with debugpy, or you may send a check or money order for US $5.00, including the product name (debugpy), the open source component name (PyDev.Debugger) and version number, to: Source Code Compliance Team, Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, USA.

Eclipse Public License, Version 1.0 (EPL-1.0)
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/debugpy/_vendored/pydevd/pydevd_attach_to_process/README.txt
This folder contains the utilities to attach a target process to the pydev debugger.

The main module to be called for the attach is:

attach_pydevd.py

it should be called as;

python attach_pydevd.py --port 5678 --pid 1234

Note that the client is responsible for having a remote debugger alive in the given port for the attach to work.


The binaries are now compiled at:
- https://github.com/fabioz/PyDev.Debugger.binaries/actions
(after generation the binaries are copied to this repo)


To copy:
cd /D X:\PyDev.Debugger
"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z" e C:\Users\fabio\Downloads\win_binaries.zip -oX:\PyDev.Debugger\pydevd_attach_to_process * -r -y

File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/debugpy/_vendored/pydevd/pydevd_plugins/extensions/README.md
Extensions allow extending the debugger without modifying the debugger code. This is implemented with explicit namespace
packages.

To implement your own extension:

1. Ensure that the root folder of your extension is in sys.path (add it to PYTHONPATH) 
2. Ensure that your module follows the directory structure below
3. The ``__init__.py`` files inside the pydevd_plugin and extension folder must contain the preamble below,
and nothing else.
Preamble: 
```python
try:
    __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)
except ImportError:
    import pkgutil
    __path__ = pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__)
```
4. Your plugin name inside the extensions folder must start with `"pydevd_plugin"`
5. Implement one or more of the abstract base classes defined in `_pydevd_bundle.pydevd_extension_api`. This can be done
by either inheriting from them or registering with the abstract base class.

* Directory structure:
```
|--  root_directory-> must be on python path
|    |-- pydevd_plugins
|    |   |-- __init__.py -> must contain preamble
|    |   |-- extensions
|    |   |   |-- __init__.py -> must contain preamble
|    |   |   |-- pydevd_plugin_plugin_name.py

This folder contains vendored dependencies of the debugger.

Right now this means the 'bytecode' library (MIT license).

To update the version remove the bytecode* contents from this folder and then use:

pip install bytecode --target .

or from master (if needed for some early bugfix):

python -m pip install https://github.com/MatthieuDartiailh/bytecode/archive/main.zip --target .

Then run 'pydevd_fix_code.py' to fix the imports on the vendored file, run its tests (to see
if things are still ok) and commit.

Then, to finish, apply the patch to add the offset to the instructions (bcb8a28669e9178f96f5d71af7259e0674acc47c)

Note: commit the egg-info as a note of the license (force if needed).

=======================================================
 Nose plugin with IPython and extension module support
=======================================================

This directory provides the key functionality for test support that IPython
needs as a nose plugin, which can be installed for use in projects other than
IPython.

The presence of a Makefile here is mostly for development and debugging
purposes as it only provides a few shorthand commands.  You can manually
install the plugin by using standard Python procedures (``setup.py install``
with appropriate arguments).

To install the plugin using the Makefile, edit its first line to reflect where
you'd like the installation.

Once you've set the prefix, simply build/install the plugin with::

  make

and run the tests with::

  make test

You should see output similar to::

  maqroll[plugin]> make test
  nosetests -s --with-ipdoctest --doctest-tests dtexample.py
  ..
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 2 tests in 0.016s

  OK



---



File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/IPython/testing/plugin/test_combo.txt
=======================
 Combo testing example
=======================

This is a simple example that mixes ipython doctests::

    In [1]: import code

    In [2]: 2**12
    Out[2]: 4096

with command-line example information that does *not* get executed::

    $ mpirun -n 4 ipengine --controller-port=10000 --controller-ip=host0

and with literal examples of Python source code::

    controller = dict(host='myhost',
		      engine_port=None, # default is 10105
		      control_port=None,
		      )

    # keys are hostnames, values are the number of engine on that host
    engines = dict(node1=2,
		   node2=2,
		   node3=2,
		   node3=2,
		   )

    # Force failure to detect that this test is being run.
    1/0

These source code examples are executed but no output is compared at all.  An
error or failure is reported only if an exception is raised.

NOTE: the execution of pure python blocks is not yet working!


---



File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/IPython/testing/plugin/test_example.txt
=====================================
 Tests in example form - pure python
=====================================

This file contains doctest examples embedded as code blocks, using normal
Python prompts.  See the accompanying file for similar examples using IPython
prompts (you can't mix both types within one file). The following will be run
as a test::

    >>> 1+1
    2
    >>> print ("hello")
    hello

More than one example works::

    >>> s="Hello World"

    >>> s.upper()
    'HELLO WORLD'

but you should note that the *entire* test file is considered to be a single
test.  Individual code blocks that fail are printed separately as ``example
failures``, but the whole file is still counted and reported as one test.


---



File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/IPython/testing/plugin/test_exampleip.txt
=================================
 Tests in example form - IPython
=================================

You can write text files with examples that use IPython prompts (as long as you
use the nose ipython doctest plugin), but you can not mix and match prompt
styles in a single file.  That is, you either use all ``>>>`` prompts or all
IPython-style prompts.  Your test suite *can* have both types, you just need to
put each type of example in a separate. Using IPython prompts, you can paste
directly from your session::

    In [5]: s="Hello World"

    In [6]: s.upper()
    Out[6]: 'HELLO WORLD'

Another example::

    In [8]: 1+3
    Out[8]: 4

Just like in IPython docstrings, you can use all IPython syntax and features::

    In [9]: !echo hello
    hello

    In [10]: a='hi'

    In [11]: !echo $a
    hi

File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/isapi/README.txt
A Python ISAPI extension.  Contributed by Phillip Frantz, and is
Copyright 2002-2003 by Blackdog Software Pty Ltd.

See the 'samples' directory, and particularly samples\README.txt

You can find documentation in the PyWin32.chm file that comes with pywin32 - 
you can open this from Pythonwin->Help, or from the start menu.

---



File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/isapi/samples/README.txt
In this directory you will find examples of ISAPI filters and extensions.

The filter loading mechanism works like this:
* IIS loads the special Python "loader" DLL.  This DLL will generally have a 
  leading underscore as part of its name.
* This loader DLL looks for a Python module, by removing the first letter of
  the DLL base name.
  
This means that an ISAPI extension module consists of 2 key files - the loader
DLL (eg, "_MyIISModule.dll", and a Python module (which for this example
would be "MyIISModule.py")

When you install an ISAPI extension, the installation code checks to see if
there is a loader DLL for your implementation file - if one does not exist, 
or the standard loader is different, it is copied and renamed accordingly.

We use this mechanism to provide the maximum separation between different
Python extensions installed on the same server - otherwise filter order and
other tricky IIS semantics would need to be replicated.  Also, each filter
gets its own thread-pool, etc.

File: ./.venv/Lib/site-packages/numpy/core/tests/data/umath-validation-set-README.txt
Steps to validate transcendental functions:
1) Add a file 'umath-validation-set-<ufuncname>.txt', where ufuncname is name of
   the function in NumPy you want to validate
2) The file should contain 4 columns: dtype,input,expected output,ulperror
    a. dtype: one of np.float16, np.float32, np.float64
    b. input: floating point input to ufunc in hex. Example: 0x414570a4
       represents 12.340000152587890625
    c. expected output: floating point output for the corresponding input in hex.
       This should be computed using a high(er) precision library and then rounded to
       same format as the input.
    d. ulperror: expected maximum ulp error of the function. This
       should be same across all rows of the same dtype. Otherwise, the function is
       tested for the maximum ulp error among all entries of that dtype.
3) Add file umath-validation-set-<ufuncname>.txt to the test file test_umath_accuracy.py
   which will then validate your ufunc.

.. -*- rest -*-

==================================================
API changes in the new masked array implementation
==================================================

Masked arrays are subclasses of ndarray
---------------------------------------

Contrary to the original implementation, masked arrays are now regular
ndarrays::

  >>> x = masked_array([1,2,3],mask=[0,0,1])
  >>> print isinstance(x, numpy.ndarray)
  True


``_data`` returns a view of the masked array
--------------------------------------------

Masked arrays are composed of a ``_data`` part and a ``_mask``. Accessing the
``_data`` part will return a regular ndarray or any of its subclass, depending
on the initial data::

  >>> x = masked_array(numpy.matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]),mask=[[0,0],[0,1]])
  >>> print x._data
  [[1 2]
   [3 4]]
  >>> print type(x._data)
  <class 'numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix.matrix'>


In practice, ``_data`` is implemented as a property, not as an attribute.
Therefore, you cannot access it directly, and some simple tests such as the
following one will fail::

  >>>x._data is x._data
  False


``filled(x)`` can return a subclass of ndarray
----------------------------------------------
The function ``filled(a)`` returns an array of the same type as ``a._data``::

  >>> x = masked_array(numpy.matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]),mask=[[0,0],[0,1]])
  >>> y = filled(x)
  >>> print type(y)
  <class 'numpy.matrixlib.defmatrix.matrix'>
  >>> print y
  matrix([[     1,      2],
          [     3, 999999]])


``put``, ``putmask`` behave like their ndarray counterparts
-----------------------------------------------------------

Previously, ``putmask`` was used like this::

  mask = [False,True,True]
  x = array([1,4,7],mask=mask)
  putmask(x,mask,[3])

which translated to::

  x[~mask] = [3]

(Note that a ``True``-value in a mask suppresses a value.)

In other words, the mask had the same length as ``x``, whereas
``values`` had ``sum(~mask)`` elements.

Now, the behaviour is similar to that of ``ndarray.putmask``, where
the mask and the values are both the same length as ``x``, i.e.

::

  putmask(x,mask,[3,0,0])


``fill_value`` is a property
----------------------------

``fill_value`` is no longer a method, but a property::

  >>> print x.fill_value
  999999

``cumsum`` and ``cumprod`` ignore missing values
------------------------------------------------

Missing values are assumed to be the identity element, i.e. 0 for
``cumsum`` and 1 for ``cumprod``::

  >>> x = N.ma.array([1,2,3,4],mask=[False,True,False,False])
  >>> print x
  [1 -- 3 4]
  >>> print x.cumsum()
  [1 -- 4 8]
  >> print x.cumprod()
  [1 -- 3 12]

``bool(x)`` raises a ValueError
-------------------------------

Masked arrays now behave like regular ``ndarrays``, in that they cannot be
converted to booleans:

::

  >>> x = N.ma.array([1,2,3])
  >>> bool(x)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()


==================================
New features (non exhaustive list)
==================================

``mr_``
-------

``mr_`` mimics the behavior of ``r_`` for masked arrays::

  >>> np.ma.mr_[3,4,5]
  masked_array(data = [3 4 5],
        mask = False,
        fill_value=999999)


``anom``
--------

The ``anom`` method returns the deviations from the average (anomalies).

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*                                                                      *

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

COM Test Suite Readme
---------------------

Running the test suite:
-----------------------
* Open a command prompt
* Change to the "win32com\test" directory.
* run "testall.py".  This will perform level 1 testing.
  You may specify 1, 2, or 3 on the command line ("testutil 3")
  to execute more tests.

In general, this should just run the best it can, utilizing what is available
on the machine.  It is likely some tests will refuse to run due to objects not
being locally available - this is normal.

The win32com source tree has source code to a C++ and VB component used purely
for testing.  You may like to build and register these, particularly if you 
are doing anything related to argument/result handling.

File: ./disciples-Acts-2/projectproposal.md
1. Prepare a proposal for one of the following suggestions:

Create a new website for a business owner who runs various operations. The owner has three main parts of the website that each have their own requirements. The business owner recommends a specific tech stack that is not required but definitely recommended for ease of creation in budget and in time limitations. The first part of 3 of the app is due in 1 week, and there is already existing computer programming code for the first part of the app so the project manager isnt required to use alot of time for that. The second main part of the website app has existing code and is required 1 week after the first main part is finished, and the third main part of the app is due in at least 1 year. The website app in itself is a pilot project for the business owner and is requesting the project manager to help make the code. If the project manager does a good job he will be offered to have partial ownership and future benefits from the website app that is created. 

Proposal should include the following:

## Statement of customers need. ##
The customer's need is multifacetted. They need a website. They need a project manager to help direct a team of programmers to create the website. The website has three main parts. 
1. Part one is called oikos which helps the user map out the people they are mentoring. 
2. Part two is called communities which helps the user map out the communities they equip. 
3. Part three is called zipmapper which helps the user map out the zipcodes, regions, and pins.

They have quite a fast time budget on the part one and two. There already is existing code for part 1 and two, but not much at all for part three. Part 1 and 2 are projects where the project manager and programers are responsible for taking existing code that the owner has access to and custom tailoring it based on the owner's requirements. Project 1 is due in 1 week upon the project proposal's approval. Project 2 is due in 1 week after project 1 (even if project 1 is delayed). Project 3 is less high in demand and is due in 1 year. The customer mentioned that they will have another project manager do the project, but I must offer them a project proposal as a screening to to confirm or deny my work provided to them.

Project Proposal

Title: Development of a Three-Part Website Application for Business Operations

Statement of Customer Need: The customer requires a website application with three main parts: Oikos, Communities, and Zipmapper. Each part has unique functionalities to aid in their business operations. They also require a project manager to guide a team of programmers in creating this website. The customer may decide for someone else to write the code for part three, that will be another project manager that will work on addng part three to the website. 

Assumptions (Organized by category):

Techstack
    The customer has a recommended tech stack for the project.
    The customer's website is written in Javascript, css, html
    The customer will require the project manager to pay for and provide his own services for building the website. 
Pay after completion
    The customer won't pay the project manager or the programmers before the project is delivered, they have to do the work first and then get paid afterwards so the project manager should make sure to plan for programmer salaries out of pocket and get paid back for this by the completion payments.\
Existing Code for Website 
    The customer will provide the existing code to be used for the website instead of having to create brand new code from the ground up. 
    The existing code for parts one and two can be adapted to meet the customer's requirements.
Not all work is promised to project manager within the needs.
    The customer is open to a different project manager handling the third part of the project.


Project Scope: Create a website that combines three apps into one website. The three apps are, , and . The first app must allow for the user to use the exisitng code to add the people they are mentoring, when the user clicks on a person they are mentoring it opens a menu and allows the user to store specific data per person they are mentoring and it allows for the main menu where you can see all the poeple you are mentoring to be displayed in a tree view where you can see all the people zoom in and out and click on the shape that represents each person and clicking on a shape will allow for the user to display the data for that person. You can store name, address, phone number, and next steps for each person in a tree view from top down where your name shows up and you can keep notes for yourself as well, but notes for them. This is called oikos. 
    The next part of the website is called communities and it works similar to oikos but instead of people you are mentoring, it says communities. This lets you map out communities that you are training. You can train communities this way to grow and thrive with custom menus for each communitiy so that you can see which communities you are mentoring. This app has a special requirement. It requires a custom node box called team and the team will have the communities underneath it in a tree view that the team is aiming to equip. You can add a new team and you can add communities underneath that team. Each team comes from a community so this will let you map communities, and who is training which community. It also stores the communities in this tree in a map format and allows you to click on a box and open a menu and name the community, date, address, list of people etc. The scope could be more narrow, but it is exactly the oikos app, but instead of mapping people you're mentoring, youre mapping communities you are training. 
        Finally part three is zip mapper. this will be an app that will basically be an google my maps clone. It will let you have access to a map with layers. There will be a layer called county which will allow you to have county layers on the map, zipcodes which will allow you to add zipcodes on the map, and you can hand draw regions and add custom pins. This map should be able for teams to access. The map is customizable. You can import an excel sheet and it will add pins to the map that have the location tab, and it should have an excel sheet viewer that will let you view the database and edit it realtime that will update the map real time. You should be able to see in the excel sheet the names that are red if they don't have a location assigned to them, and see the names that arent red if they are showing up on the map. Zip mapper will allow you to see where the people are that you are mentoring, and where the communities are that you are training using community mapper. This third part of the website integrates with the first and second parts of the website. This will allow the user to view the mentor mapper people on the map and see which associated communities they are investing in. Not everyone you mentor will invest in impacting a community so this is why the website has three parts. The mentor mapper has more names, they can be displayed on zipmapper per zipcode. The community mapper can display which communities those you are mentoring are investing in. 


Deliverables:

A fully functional website application with three main parts.
Documentation of the development process and final product.
Training materials for users and administrators.
Resources:

Project Manager - Me
    Team of Programmers - Me and 1 other. 
    Existing code for parts one and two - access through customer. 
    Techstack Resources required for building the website:
        Supabase: For database and user signup and sign in. 
        Github: for existing code, and new changes
        Vercel: for hosting the code in a website 
        Namecheap: the domain name provider for the website


    

Schedule:
    Day 1 upon approval of the project, the project manager and the programmers are expected to start the project using their desired project management approach as long as it gets the following schedule requirements done on time seen below:

        Part one: Due in 1 week from project proposal approval.
                    Expected due date: May 17, 2024
        Part two: Due in 1 week after part one's completion.
                    Expected due date: May 24, 2024
        Part three: Due in 1 year.
                    Expected due date: May 24, 2025 (1 year)

Price: The estimated cost of the project is $40 per month in resources bought for building the app (Supabase, and Vercel), and a yearly cost of $25 upon first purchase for the domain name which will renew in 2025 for $25 a year starting in 5/10/2025. This includes development, project management costs, and potential future maintenance.

Risks:
    Techstack
        1. Technical difficulties in any of the required resources. 
        2. Learning curve for any new technologies that the programmers end up not being able to overcome. 
        3. Sudden price surges as unforseen costs rise upon needs for new resources to make the app work that cost more than budgetted. 
    Scope Changes
        4. Customer isn't happy with the way it's going and changes the scope. 
    Off Schedule
        5. Our team doesn't get the project done on schedule and is delayed and in danger of losing the project approval. 
    Security Risks
        6. App ends up not being secure and causes users info to be at risk of hackers.
Risk mitigation plan:
    Techstack
        1. Have a stakeholder chart of subject matter experts to reference in times of need, especially on stallations. Have a clear plan of action on how to communicate with the techstack resource providers including customer support, and access to their documentation put in our project management team's website. The project manager creating a custom team website to keep the how-to videos, and project information well organized so the team can know what resources are available if they get stuck on a project and need advice. 
        2. Having access to subject matter experts and making sure we keep a log of their contacts, and our previous converstaions. This is an ongoing risk mitigation plan that starts in the initiation and planning phase of the project. The project manager needs to keep a list of subject matter experts as key stakeholders for the project and use an excel sheet to track their vested interest in the project, and how well our relationship is with each of the stakeholders to ensure that we do good stakeholder relationship management and communication with the key SM Experts (SME). 
        2.1. Having tutorials for each of the applications and technologies ready. Any useful videos that any of the team members have found for hard problems using any of the techstack resources, make a space on the team website to paste useful video links so that each team member can be well informed on the useful tutorials and have a quick reference location. This will allow unversed team members to have access to videos that destroy knowledge barriers and allow programmers to more quickly code. One downside and risk to this is that if we spend too much time on these videos in our 1 week due date we can actually be late because of studying. The videos should be accessed and used in that quick reference videos tab on that website if there is a case where a team member runs into a hard problem and can't move forward. This location serves as a place for each team member to store resources they found most useful on the project. 
        3. Plan to discourage sudden rises in prices is to encourage team members to stick with the tech stack even if there seems to be another solution that is easier and cheaper. This requires the project manager to be ontop of the team members status on their progress. If someone is stuck and is considering changing the tech stack that could take time and money in new resources that seem easier but are delaying the team if the existing tech stack can make it work. The plan in this case is to feed the team members the right videos and training resources to use the existing resources we are paying for instead of allowing them to go use other resources if the existing ones can get the job done. This requires clear communication to each team member about the expectations that we will not be changing the techstack under many conditions at all and that new tech stack solutions require for active communication. We can use technologies on the teams website to allow each member to store their techstack using a website like techstack.io so that the project manager can see which resources each user is using, and which ones he needs to pay money for to allow the programmers to do their job. The techstack viewer will allow the team to stick to one set of solutions and give accountability. 
    Scope changes
        4. To ensure the customer isn't happy and changes scope. Our communication plan with the customer is to let them know what we are doing daily so there is no misunderstanding on our progress. They can clearly know where we are at in our progress. This is the agile project management stand up meetings where we plan on discussing with the team our progress each day, and the customer is always welcome to join in on our stand up meetings. These serve to update the customer our progress and allow them to communicate to us if there is a change. In this approach a delay in progress will not be a surprise because the customer will be able to see our progress daily and communicate with us if we are behind.

Project Proposal: SalvationMapper
Project Title:
SalvationMapper: Empowering Mentorship and Community Engagement

Project Overview:
SalvationMapper is a proposed web application designed to revolutionize mentorship and community development initiatives. By integrating three distinct modules, Oikos, Communities, and Zipmapper, the platform will streamline the user's ability to manage mentoring relationships, engage with communities, and visualize their impact on a map-based interface.

Customer Needs:
The customer, a business owner, seeks a dynamic website application to enhance their operations. They require a project manager to oversee a team of programmers in developing this application, consisting of three main parts:

Oikos: A tool to help users organize and track their mentoring efforts, allowing them to store specific data about each mentee.
Communities: A module similar to Oikos but focused on communities, enabling users to map and train communities, and visualize their growth.
Zipmapper: A mapping application, akin to Google My Maps, allowing users to layer counties, zip codes, and custom pins, integrating with Oikos and Communities to visualize the locations of mentees and communities.
The customer has existing code for parts one and two, and a recommended tech stack, although it is not mandatory. They also mention the possibility of another project manager for part three, making this proposal a screening process.

Assumptions:
    The customer recommends a tech stack, and the website is expected to be in Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
    The project manager will initially cover the costs of building the website, with the customer paying after completion.
    Existing code for parts one and two can be adapted to meet requirements, but part three will require more development.
    The customer may opt for a different project manager for part three.

Project Scope:
    The project scope encompasses creating a website that integrates the three distinct apps into one seamless platform. Oikos will enable users to manage mentoring relationships, Communities will facilitate community training and engagement, and Zipmapper will provide a visual mapping tool.

Deliverables:
    A fully functional three-part website application.
    Comprehensive documentation of the development process and final product.
    User-friendly training materials for administrators and users.

Resources:
    Project Manager: Overseeing the entire project, coordinating with the team, and ensuring timely delivery.
    Team of Programmers: Experienced in the required tech stack, responsible for coding and development.
    Existing Code: Provided by the customer for parts one and two, serving as a foundation.
    Techstack Resources: Supabase for database and user management, Github for code management, Vercel for hosting, and Namecheap for the domain name.

Schedule:
Part one: Due in 1 week from project proposal approval (Expected due date: May 17, 2024).
Part two: Due 1 week after part one's completion (Expected due date: May 24, 2024).
Part three: Due in 1 year (Expected due date: May 24, 2025).
Estimated programmer schedule: 2 hours per day, 10-14 hours a week. 

## Project Cost Breakdown

### Part 1 and 2
- Resources (Supabase and Vercel): $40/month
- Domain name: $25/year (starting in 2025)
- Labor:
    - Project manager: $0 (paid after project completion)
    - Programmer 1: $20/hour
        - Week 1: Expected = $280
            - If delayed by 1 week = $560
            - Total with contingency = $600
        - Week 2: Expected = $280
            - If delayed by 1 week = $560
            - Total with contingency = $600
    - Unexpected resources fund:
        - Week 1: $100
        - Week 2: $20
    - Grand total for labor = $1320
- Customer payout for part 1 and 2 = $2000

### Part 3
- Customer payout = $5000
- Resources required:
    - Custom map layers (counties): $50
    - Supabase login: $50
    - List of custom locations: $500
    - Programmer hours (56 hours): $1120
    - Resources contingencies: $500
- Total cost for part 3 = $2220

### Summary
- Grand total cost for all parts = $1320 (part 1 and 2) + $2220 (part 3) = $3540
- Total customer payout = $2000 (part 1 and 2) + $5000 (part 3) = $7000





    Volunteer Programmer: 0

Risks:
    Technical difficulties with resources, learning curves, and unforeseen price surges.
    Scope changes due to customer dissatisfaction.
    Delays in development, impacting the overall timeline.
    Security risks, exposing user information to potential hackers.

Risk Mitigation Plan:

    Techstack: Prepare a stakeholder chart of subject matter experts, ensure clear communication with resource providers, and create a centralized repository for how-to videos and project information.

    Learning Curve: Maintain access to subject matter experts, document contacts, and regularly update tutorials for each technology.

    Price Surges: Encourage the team to stick to the chosen tech stack, provide clear expectations, and regularly review resource usage.

    Scope Changes: Implement daily stand-up meetings with the team and customer, ensuring transparency and early detection of potential scope changes.

    Delays: Closely monitor the project schedule, promptly address potential delays, and maintain open communication with stakeholders.

    Security Risks: Implement robust security measures, conduct regular audits, and prioritize data protection.

Expected Benefits:
Improved business operations through an efficient, integrated web application.
Potential for partial ownership and future benefits for the project manager, incentivizing long-term commitment.

Project Management Approach:
As the project manager, I aim to foster a collaborative environment, engaging all stakeholders well in decision-making. My approach is less traditional and more agile hybrid. It is a softare project, but the code for the first two parts is pretty straight forward and doesn't need much change so a more traditional approach of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring progress and concluding part 1 and part 2 of the app works. Part 3 of the app will take a more solid agile approach as it will be much more iterative how we will build it. We have the resources we need to build it, but having to build from the ground up requires multiple sprints and user stories to get to the final outcome in 1 year for part 3. Throughout the three parts of the project, regular meetings are planned to be held to discuss progress, address issues, and adapt strategies. These include breif trterrgtyjukli;op'
['p/;.lkujbtgrfdsaqs23df4gbhjkdaily standup meetings, and other agile and traditional meetings. The project schedule will be meticulously monitored, and any delays will be promptly addressed. A systematic problem-solving approach will be employed, ensuring effective solutions. Stakeholders will receive regular updates, and their feedback will shape the project's direction.

SalvationMapper aims to empower the customer's mentorship and community engagement initiatives, offering a solution that helps users mentor people, communities, and map visually on a physical map.

1. Prepare a proposal for one of the following suggestions:

Create a new website for a business owner who runs various operations. The owner has three main parts of the website that each have their own requirements. The business owner recommends a specific tech stack that is not required but definitely recommended for ease of creation in budget and in time limitations. The first part of 3 of the app is due in 1 week, and there is already existing computer programming code for the first part of the app so the project manager isnt required to use alot of time for that. The second main part of the website app has existing code and is required 1 week after the first main part is finished, and the third main part of the app is due in at least 1 year. The website app in itself is a pilot project for the business owner and is requesting the project manager to help make the code. If the project manager does a good job he will be offered to have partial ownership and future benefits from the website app that is created. 

Proposal should include the following:

## Statement of customers need. ##
The customer's need is multifacetted. They need a website. They need a project manager to help direct a team of programmers to create the website. The website has three main parts. 
1. Part one is called oikos which helps the user map out the people they are mentoring. 
2. Part two is called communities which helps the user map out the communities they equip. 
3. Part three is called zipmapper which helps the user map out the zipcodes, regions, and pins.

They have quite a fast time budget on the part one and two. There already is existing code for part 1 and two, but not much at all for part three. Part 1 and 2 are projects where the project manager and programers are responsible for taking existing code that the owner has access to and custom tailoring it based on the owner's requirements. Project 1 is due in 1 week upon the project proposal's approval. Project 2 is due in 1 week after project 1 (even if project 1 is delayed). Project 3 is less high in demand and is due in 1 year. The customer mentioned that they will have another project manager do the project, but I must offer them a project proposal as a screening to to confirm or deny my work provided to them.

Title: Development of a Three-Part Website Application for Business Operations

Statement of Customer Need: The customer requires a website application with three main parts: Oikos, Communities, and Zipmapper. Each part has unique functionalities to aid in their business operations. They also require a project manager to guide a team of programmers in creating this website. The customer may decide for someone else to write the code for part three, that will be another project manager that will work on addng part three to the website. 

Assumptions (Organized by category):

Techstack
    The customer has a recommended tech stack for the project.
    The customer's website is written in Javascript, css, html
    The customer will require the project manager to pay for and provide his own services for building the website. 
Pay after completion
    The customer won't pay the project manager or the programmers before the project is delivered, they have to do the work first and then get paid afterwards so the project manager should make sure to plan for programmer salaries out of pocket and get paid back for this by the completion payments.\
Existing Code for Website 
    The customer will provide the existing code to be used for the website instead of having to create brand new code from the ground up. 
    The existing code for parts one and two can be adapted to meet the customer's requirements.
Not all work is promised to project manager within the needs.
    The customer is open to a different project manager handling the third part of the project.


Project Scope: Create a website that combines three apps into one website. The three apps are, , and . The first app must allow for the user to use the exisitng code to add the people they are mentoring, when the user clicks on a person they are mentoring it opens a menu and allows the user to store specific data per person they are mentoring and it allows for the main menu where you can see all the poeple you are mentoring to be displayed in a tree view where you can see all the people zoom in and out and click on the shape that represents each person and clicking on a shape will allow for the user to display the data for that person. You can store name, address, phone number, and next steps for each person in a tree view from top down where your name shows up and you can keep notes for yourself as well, but notes for them. This is called oikos. 
    The next part of the website is called communities and it works similar to oikos but instead of people you are mentoring, it says communities. This lets you map out communities that you are training. You can train communities this way to grow and thrive with custom menus for each communitiy so that you can see which communities you are mentoring. This app has a special requirement. It requires a custom node box called team and the team will have the communities underneath it in a tree view that the team is aiming to equip. You can add a new team and you can add communities underneath that team. Each team comes from a community so this will let you map communities, and who is training which community. It also stores the communities in this tree in a map format and allows you to click on a box and open a menu and name the community, date, address, list of people etc. The scope could be more narrow, but it is exactly the oikos app, but instead of mapping people you're mentoring, youre mapping communities you are training. 
        Finally part three is zip mapper. this will be an app that will basically be an google my maps clone. It will let you have access to a map with layers. There will be a layer called county which will allow you to have county layers on the map, zipcodes which will allow you to add zipcodes on the map, and you can hand draw regions and add custom pins. This map should be able for teams to access. The map is customizable. You can import an excel sheet and it will add pins to the map that have the location tab, and it should have an excel sheet viewer that will let you view the database and edit it realtime that will update the map real time. You should be able to see in the excel sheet the names that are red if they don't have a location assigned to them, and see the names that arent red if they are showing up on the map. Zip mapper will allow you to see where the people are that you are mentoring, and where the communities are that you are training using community mapper. This third part of the website integrates with the first and second parts of the website. This will allow the user to view the mentor mapper people on the map and see which associated communities they are investing in. Not everyone you mentor will invest in impacting a community so this is why the website has three parts. The mentor mapper has more names, they can be displayed on zipmapper per zipcode. The community mapper can display which communities those you are mentoring are investing in.

    Day 1 upon approval of the project, the project manager and the programmers are expected to start the project using their desired project management approach as long as it gets the following schedule requirements done on time seen below:

        Part one: Due in 1 week from project proposal approval.
                    Expected due date: May 17, 2024
        Part two: Due in 1 week after part one's completion.
                    Expected due date: May 24, 2024
        Part three: Due in 1 year.
                    Expected due date: May 24, 2025 (1 year)

Price: The estimated cost of the project is $40 per month in resources bought for building the app (Supabase, and Vercel), and a yearly cost of $25 upon first purchase for the domain name which will renew in 2025 for $25 a year starting in 5/10/2025. This includes development, project management costs, and potential future maintenance.

Risks:
    Techstack
        1. Technical difficulties in any of the required resources. 
        2. Learning curve for any new technologies that the programmers end up not being able to overcome. 
        3. Sudden price surges as unforseen costs rise upon needs for new resources to make the app work that cost more than budgetted. 
    Scope Changes
        4. Customer isn't happy with the way it's going and changes the scope. 
    Off Schedule
        5. Our team doesn't get the project done on schedule and is delayed and in danger of losing the project approval. 
    Security Risks
        6. App ends up not being secure and causes users info to be at risk of hackers.
Risk mitigation plan:
    Techstack
        1. Have a stakeholder chart of subject matter experts to reference in times of need, especially on stallations. Have a clear plan of action on how to communicate with the techstack resource providers including customer support, and access to their documentation put in our project management team's website. The project manager creating a custom team website to keep the how-to videos, and project information well organized so the team can know what resources are available if they get stuck on a project and need advice. 
        2. Having access to subject matter experts and making sure we keep a log of their contacts, and our previous converstaions. This is an ongoing risk mitigation plan that starts in the initiation and planning phase of the project. The project manager needs to keep a list of subject matter experts as key stakeholders for the project and use an excel sheet to track their vested interest in the project, and how well our relationship is with each of the stakeholders to ensure that we do good stakeholder relationship management and communication with the key SM Experts (SME). 
        2.1. Having tutorials for each of the applications and technologies ready. Any useful videos that any of the team members have found for hard problems using any of the techstack resources, make a space on the team website to paste useful video links so that each team member can be well informed on the useful tutorials and have a quick reference location. This will allow unversed team members to have access to videos that destroy knowledge barriers and allow programmers to more quickly code. One downside and risk to this is that if we spend too much time on these videos in our 1 week due date we can actually be late because of studying. The videos should be accessed and used in that quick reference videos tab on that website if there is a case where a team member runs into a hard problem and can't move forward. This location serves as a place for each team member to store resources they found most useful on the project. 
        3. Plan to discourage sudden rises in prices is to encourage team members to stick with the tech stack even if there seems to be another solution that is easier and cheaper. This requires the project manager to be ontop of the team members status on their progress. If someone is stuck and is considering changing the tech stack that could take time and money in new resources that seem easier but are delaying the team if the existing tech stack can make it work. The plan in this case is to feed the team members the right videos and training resources to use the existing resources we are paying for instead of allowing them to go use other resources if the existing ones can get the job done. This requires clear communication to each team member about the expectations that we will not be changing the techstack under many conditions at all and that new tech stack solutions require for active communication. We can use technologies on the teams website to allow each member to store their techstack using a website like techstack.io so that the project manager can see which resources each user is using, and which ones he needs to pay money for to allow the programmers to do their job. The techstack viewer will allow the team to stick to one set of solutions and give accountability. 
    Scope changes
        4. To ensure the customer isn't happy and changes scope. Our communication plan with the customer is to let them know what we are doing daily so there is no misunderstanding on our progress. They can clearly know where we are at in our progress. This is the agile project management stand up meetings where we plan on discussing with the team our progress each day, and the customer is always welcome to join in on our stand up meetings. These serve to update the customer our progress and allow them to communicate to us if there is a change. In this approach a delay in progress will not be a surprise because the customer will be able to see our progress daily and communicate with us if we are behind.

Project Proposal: SalvationMapper
Project Title:
SalvationMapper: Empowering Mentorship and Community Engagement

Project Overview:
SalvationMapper is a proposed web application designed to revolutionize mentorship and community development initiatives. By integrating three distinct modules, Oikos, Communities, and Zipmapper, the platform will streamline the user's ability to manage mentoring relationships, engage with communities, and visualize their impact on a map-based interface.

Customer Needs:
The customer, a business owner, seeks a dynamic website application to enhance their operations. They require a project manager to oversee a team of programmers in developing this application, consisting of three main parts:

Oikos: A tool to help users organize and track their mentoring efforts, allowing them to store specific data about each mentee.
Communities: A module similar to Oikos but focused on communities, enabling users to map and train communities, and visualize their growth.
Zipmapper: A mapping application, akin to Google My Maps, allowing users to layer counties, zip codes, and custom pins, integrating with Oikos and Communities to visualize the locations of mentees and communities.
The customer has existing code for parts one and two, and a recommended tech stack, although it is not mandatory. They also mention the possibility of another project manager for part three, making this proposal a screening process.

Assumptions:
    The customer recommends a tech stack, and the website is expected to be in Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
    The project manager will initially cover the costs of building the website, with the customer paying after completion.
    Existing code for parts one and two can be adapted to meet requirements, but part three will require more development.
    The customer may opt for a different project manager for part three.

Project Scope:
    The project scope encompasses creating a website that integrates the three distinct apps into one seamless platform. Oikos will enable users to manage mentoring relationships, Communities will facilitate community training and engagement, and Zipmapper will provide a visual mapping tool.

Deliverables:
    A fully functional three-part website application.
    Comprehensive documentation of the development process and final product.
    User-friendly training materials for administrators and users.

Resources:
    Project Manager: Overseeing the entire project, coordinating with the team, and ensuring timely delivery.
    Team of Programmers: Experienced in the required tech stack, responsible for coding and development.
    Existing Code: Provided by the customer for parts one and two, serving as a foundation.
    Techstack Resources: Supabase for database and user management, Github for code management, Vercel for hosting, and Namecheap for the domain name.

Schedule:
Part one: Due in 1 week from project proposal approval (Expected due date: May 17, 2024).
Part two: Due 1 week after part one's completion (Expected due date: May 24, 2024).
Part three: Due in 1 year (Expected due date: May 24, 2025).
Estimated programmer schedule: 2 hours per day, 10-14 hours a week. 

## Project Cost Breakdown

### Part 1 and 2
- Resources (Supabase and Vercel): $40/month
- Domain name: $25/year (starting in 2025)
- Labor:
    - Project manager: $0 (paid after project completion)

        - Week 2: Expected = $280
            - If delayed by 1 week = $560
            - Total with contingency = $600
    - Unexpected resources fund:
        - Week 1: $100
        - Week 2: $20
    - Grand total for labor = $1320
- Customer payout for part 1 and 2 = $2000

### Part 3
- Customer payout = $5000
- Resources required:
    - Custom map layers (counties): $50
    - Supabase login: $50
    - List of custom locations: $500
    - Programmer hours (56 hours): $1120
    - Resources contingencies: $500
- Total cost for part 3 = $2220

### Summary
- Grand total cost for all parts = $1320 (part 1 and 2) + $2220 (part 3) = $3540
- Total customer payout = $2000 (part 1 and 2) + $5000 (part 3) = $7000





    Volunteer Programmer: 0

Risks:
    Technical difficulties with resources, learning curves, and unforeseen price surges.
    Scope changes due to customer dissatisfaction.
    Delays in development, impacting the overall timeline.
    Security risks, exposing user information to potential hackers.

Risk Mitigation Plan:

    Techstack: Prepare a stakeholder chart of subject matter experts, ensure clear communication with resource providers, and create a centralized repository for how-to videos and project information.

    Learning Curve: Maintain access to subject matter experts, document contacts, and regularly update tutorials for each technology.

    Price Surges: Encourage the team to stick to the chosen tech stack, provide clear expectations, and regularly review resource usage.

    Scope Changes: Implement daily stand-up meetings with the team and customer, ensuring transparency and early detection of potential scope changes.

    Delays: Closely monitor the project schedule, promptly address potential delays, and maintain open communication with stakeholders.

    Security Risks: Implement robust security measures, conduct regular audits, and prioritize data protection.

Expected Benefits:
Improved business operations through an efficient, integrated web application.
Potential for partial ownership and future benefits for the project manager, incentivizing long-term commitment.

Project Management Approach:
As the project manager, I aim to foster a collaborative environment, engaging all stakeholders well in decision-making. My approach is less traditional and more agile hybrid. It is a softare project, but the code for the first two parts is pretty straight forward and doesn't need much change so a more traditional approach of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring progress and concluding part 1 and part 2 of the app works. Part 3 of the app will take a more solid agile approach as it will be much more iterative how we will build it. We have the resources we need to build it, but having to build from the ground up requires multiple sprints and user stories to get to the final outcome in 1 year for part 3. Throughout the three parts of the project, regular meetings are planned to be held to discuss progress, address issues, and adapt strategies. These include breif trterrgtyjukli;op'
['p/;.lkujbtgrfdsaqs23df4gbhjkdaily standup meetings, and other agile and traditional meetings. The project schedule will be meticulously monitored, and any delays will be promptly addressed. A systematic problem-solving approach will be employed, ensuring effective solutions. Stakeholders will receive regular updates, and their feedback will shape the project's direction.

SalvationMapper aims to empower the customer's mentorship and community engagement initiatives, offering a solution that helps users mentor people, communities, and map visually on a physical map. 

Write a short summary on how you as the project manager would handle decisions, schedule,
   problem, and stakeholders

# Updating GitHub Pages

This tutorial will guide you through the process of updating your GitHub Pages site using the `gh-pages` branch.

## Step 1: Stage your changes

The first step is to stage the changes you've made. This prepares them for the next commit. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

    git add .

This command stages all the changes you've made in the project.

Step 2: Commit your changes
After staging your changes, you need to commit them. This saves a snapshot of your changes to the project history. Run the following command:"

    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

Replace "Your descriptive commit message" with a brief description of the changes you've made.

Step 3: Push your changes to the gh-pages branch
Now that your changes are committed, you can push them to the gh-pages branch on GitHub. Run the following command:

    git push origin gh-pages

This command pushes your changes to the gh-pages branch of the remote repository named origin.

After running these commands, your changes should be live on your GitHub Pages site. Remember, it may take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to process the changes and update the live site.

Remember to replace "Your descriptive commit message" with a brief description of the changes you've made when you commit your changes.

File: ./disciples-Prototype-A/masterplan.md
To reframe your requirements into a user story and then provide a structured solution concept, let's start with the problem statement:

### User Story Problem Statement

As a user of the GenMapper application,
I want to have a visual indication of the disciples' commitment levels,
So that I can quickly identify their ministry engagement and progress at a glance.

Specifically:

1. When I mark a disciple as committed to "soul winning", their associated node should turn blue.
2. If a disciple is marked as committed to "discipling souls", their node should turn pink.
3. When a disciple is marked as committed to both "soul winning" and "discipling souls", their node should turn purple.
4. Distinct follow-up states should have specific colors:
    - "Followed up? No, go therefore" should turn the node red.
    - "Yes, no discipleship" turns the node orange.
    - "Yes, in discipleship" turns the node green.
5. "Actively devoted to gospel sharing" is blue, and "actively devoted to discipling" turns the node purple. If "actively devoted to gospel sharing" is true (blue), it can override another state to become purple when "actively devoted to discipling" is also true.

### Solution Concept

#### Data and Event Handling

To achieve this, the application must handle checkbox changes and radio button selections dynamically. This could be managed through JavaScript event listeners attached to each input element associated with these states.

#### JavaScript Execution Flow

1. **Listen for changes**: Add event listeners to the checkboxes and radio inputs that correspond to each commitment level and follow-up state.

2. **Determine the Node Color**: When an event is triggered (state change), determine the appropriate color based on the logic defined in your user story. For checkboxes specifically, you'll need to check both "soul winning" and "discipling souls" states to decide if a node should be blue, pink, or purple. For the follow-up statuses, you will directly map statuses to colors as per the logic provided.

3. **Apply the Color**: Once the target color is identified, apply the class or directly set the style on the node element representing the disciple.

#### Example JavaScript Logic

Here is a pseudo-code concept to illustrate the approach:

```javascript
function updateDiscipleNodeColor(discipleId) {
  const discipleElement = document.querySelector(`.node[data-id="${discipleId}"]`);
  const isSoulWinning = document.getElementById(`soul-winning-${discipleId}`).checked;
  const isDisciplingSouls = document.getElementById(`discipling-souls-${discipleId}`).checked;

  // Reset classes or directly set a default style if required

  if (isSoulWinning && isDisciplingSouls) {
    // Apply purple
    discipleElement.classList.add('node-purple');
  } else if (isSoulWinning) {
    // Apply blue
    discipleElement.classList.add('node-blue');
  } else if (isDisciplingSouls) {
    // Apply pink
    discipleElement.classList.add('node-pink');
  }

  // Example for follow-up status changes
  const followUpStatus = /* Determine the follow-up status for the disciple */
  switch(followUpStatus) {
    case 'no-follow-up':
      discipleElement.classList.add('node-red');
      break;
    case 'follow-up-no-discipleship':
      discipleElement.classList.add('node-orange');
      break;
    case 'in-discipleship':
      discipleElement.classList.add('node-green');
      break;
    // handle other cases
  }
}

// Attach event listeners to relevant input elements to call updateDiscipleNodeColor with the correct discipleId on state change
```

#### CSS Styling

In your `styles.css` under the `disciples` directory, define the color classes:

```css
.node-blue > rect {
  fill: blue !important;
}

.node-pink > rect {
  fill: pink !important;
}

.node-purple > rect {
  fill: purple !important;
}

.node-red > rect {
  fill: red !important;
}

.node-orange > rect {
  fill: orange !important;
}

.node-green > rect {
  fill: green !important;
}
```

This structured approach provides a clear mapping between the checkboxes' states or follow-up options with the visual representation of disciples, facilitating instant recognition of their commitment levels and follow-up statuses.//

To update the GenMapper application code to support the desired feature of color-coding nodes based on disciples' commitments, you must include the logic for handling the 'reapercommitment' and 'disciplercommitment' fields, and ensure the visual representation matches the requirements. Given that the provided code already contains extensive functionality for handling nodes, events, and rendering, the specific updates will focus on handling the disciple commitment levels and their visual representation.

### Key Steps for Implementation:

#### 1. Update `template.js`:
Add or ensure that the `reapercommitment` and `disciplercommitment` checkboxes are included in the `fields` section of your `template.js`. It seems they are already included based on your given template definition.

#### 2. Update CSS Styling:
In `disciples/style.css`, you've already defined styles for `.node-reapercommitment` and `.node-disciplercommitment`. You might need to adjust the CSS selectors based on your actual implementation, particularly if nodes can have multiple classes or states that require specific color coding.

#### 3. Implement Color Logic in `genmapper.js`:
Enhance the `redraw` function or wherever the nodes are being drawn to apply the correct class based on

// the above code actually changes the colors of the nodes. It is a drop down menu selection and not a check box, but I can create two new menus in the same format as the above menu. One menu can be called evangelism that contains confidence, competence, and actively commited, confidence and competence will not change the color, but the third option active committed will override the followup menu and will label them as blue, and the third drop down options will be confident in discipling, competent in discipling, and actively commited. if it is selected ALONE and actively committed to evangelism then it will highlight the person as purple, but if they aren't actively commited to evangelism, but are actively commited to discipleship, then they will be pink. 
Based on your discovery and the idea of utilizing dropdown menus for different commitment levels in evangelism and discipleship, you can effectively manage and display the disciples' engagement state in visual form. This approach leverages the combination of HTML form elements (dropdown menus) and CSS for visual representation.

Here is an outline of how to implement these features:

### 1. Extend the Template

Youll add two new fields in `template.js``evangelismStatus` and `discipleshipStatus`similar to the `followupStatus` field. This allows for different commitment levels to be selected through dropdown menus.

```javascript
// example addition to the fields array in your template
{
  header: 'evangelismStatus',
  initial: 'evangelism-not-committed',
  type: 'radio',
  values: [
    { header: 'evangelism-not-committed', class: 'evangelism-not-committed' },
    { header: 'evangelism-committed', class: 'evangelism-committed' }
    // No need for additional attributes for this example
  ]
},
{
  header: 'discipleshipStatus',
  initial: 'discipleship-not-committed',
  type: 'radio',
  values: [
    { header: 'discipleship-not-committed', class: 'discipleship-not-committed' },
    { header: 'discipleship-committed', class: 'discipleship-committed' }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Define CSS Styles for New States

Next, you would define additional CSS classes in `/disciples/style.css` to visually represent these new states.

```css
.evangelism-committed > rect,
.discipleship-committed.alone > rect {
  fill: pink !important;
}

.evangelism-committed.discipleship-committed > rect {
  fill: purple !important;
}

.evangelism-committed:not(.discipleship-committed) > rect {
  fill: blue !important;
}
```

Please note: The CSS selectors `.alone` and combinators like `:not()` are used conceptually here. You will need to implement logic that dynamically adds and removes these classes based on the selections made in the dropdowns.

### 3. Implement Logic to Handle Selection Changes

You will need to modify or extend the JavaScript logic that handles dropdown selections (`genmapper.js`). On selection change, assess the combination of `evangelismStatus` and `discipleshipStatus` to apply the correct classes that determine the node's color.

This might involve adding event listeners for changes in those dropdowns, much like how checkboxes or other input elements are currently handled. 

```javascript
// Pseudo-code to illustrate the approach
function handleCommitmentChange(discipleId) {
  var discipleElement = document.querySelector(`.node[data-id="${discipleId}"]`);
  
  // Fetch selections
  var evangelismSelection = document.getElementById(`evangelism-select-${discipleId}`).value;
  var discipleshipSelection = document.getElementById(`discipleship-select-${discipleId}`).value;

  // Check and apply classes based on logic.
  discipleElement.classList.remove('evangelism-committed', 'discipleship-committed', 'alone');
  if (evangelismSelection === 'evangelism-committed') {
    discipleElement.classList.add('evangelism-committed');
  }
  if (discipleshipSelection === 'discipleship-committed') {
    discipleElement.classList.add('discipleship-committed');
  }
  // Further logic to add/remove "alone" class or applying specific logic based on selection combinations
}

// Simply ensure you add code to attach these handlers when rendering each node.
```

### Conclusion

While mixing CSS class combinations and utilizing smart event handling in JavaScript, you can dynamically adapt the visual representation of each disciple node based on the different categories of commitment. This system enables a flexible method to visually encode multiple aspects of disciples' engagement in a compact and easily understandable manner.

This overall approach will require additional logic to manage the class state of each node accurately, especially when differing combinations of commitments can lead to a change in the node's color. Remember to test thoroughly to ensure that the visual state always accurately reflects the current selections.



/<!--=============================== Adding text areas =====================-->



Within the provided `GenMapper` class code, there are several places responsible for handling and organizing field data for each node, as well as for exporting that data into a CSV format, where fields serve as headers and entries per field are saved as column data associated with each node ID. Below, I will outline key parts of the code that contribute to these functionalities:

### Isolating Field Data for Each Node

1. **Adding Nodes and Setting Initial Field Values**: The method `addNode(d)` is responsible for adding a new node with fields initialized to their default values. Here, `template.fields.forEach(...)` is used to iterate over all fields defined in the template and initialize them based on their `initial` value or `initialTranslationCode`.

2. **Editing Nodes Field Data**: The method `popupEditGroupModal(d)` is responsible for displaying a modal window where users can edit field values for a specific node. It dynamically generates input elements for each field and pre-populates them with the current values for the selected node. This functionality ensures that field data is isolated and managed on a per-node basis.

3. **Data Binding in `redraw(template)` Method**: The `redraw(template)` method is crucial for drawing and updating the visual representation of nodes. It binds data to SVG elements based on the `template.fields`. Each node's data is applied to create or update graphical elements (rectangles, texts, etc.), ensuring that each field's data is correctly represented and associated with the correct node.

### Saving Fields as Headers in a CSV, and Saving Entries as Column Data per ID

1. **CSV Header Construction**: At the constructor of the `GenMapper` class, there's a line that sets up the `csvHeader` by mapping over `template.fields` to extract headers, then joins these with commas. This ensures that when data is exported, the CSV file will have headers matching the field names defined in the fields array of the template.

    ```javascript
    this.csvHeader = template.fields.map(field => field.header).join(',') + '\n';
    ```

2. **Parsing and Exporting CSV Data**: The methods `outputCsv()` and `outputCsvSubtree(node)` are responsible for exporting the node data to a CSV file. In `outputCsvSubtree(node)`, there is a conversion of the node (and optionally its subtree) data into a string format that matches the CSV structure initiated with headers from `csvHeader`. It uses `d3.csvFormatRows(...)` to prepare the rows of data where each field from the nodes is mapped into the corresponding column under the headers.

addFieldsToEditWindow (template) {
  template.fields.forEach((field) => {
    if (field.type) {
      // add table row
      const tr = d3.select('#edit-group-content')
        .select('form')
        .select('table')
        .append('tr')
      // add left column
      const fieldDesciption = i18next.t('template.' + field.header) + ':'
      tr.append('td')
        .text(fieldDesciption)
        .attr('class', 'left-field')
      // add right column
      const td = tr.append('td')
        .attr('class', 'right-field')
      if (field.type === 'radio') {
        for (let value of field.values) {
            const valueDescription = i18next.t('template.' + value.header)
            td.append('input')
              .attr('type', field.type)
              .attr('name', field.header)
              .attr('value', value.header)
              .attr('id', 'edit-' + field.header + '-' + value.header)
            td.append('span')
              .html(valueDescription)
            td.append('br')
          }
      } else if (field.type === 'textarea') {
        td.append('textarea')
          .attr('name', field.header)
          .attr('id', 'edit-' + field.header)
          .attr('rows', '4')  // Example row size, adjust as necessary
          .attr('cols', '50');  // Example column size, adjust as necessary
      } else {
        td.append('input')
            .attr('type', field.type)
            .attr('name', field.header)
            .attr('id', 'edit-' + field.header)
      }
    }
  })

add the ability to pray for disciples into the app. you can type out prayers in the offline version, and then you can record prayers in the app version. 


You can pray for the network as a whole. add notes to it, select different branches. There needs to be a more complex database. Each branch should be kept. You should be able to click on the first generation of a stream and the ID's of the subsequent disciple generations should be mapped to the first gen. For example if there is branch 1.1

1 meaning gen 1
1."1" meaning branch 1 from the "1".1 main branch. The problem with this is, what about when a first generation disciple disciples another first generation disciple. It wouldn't be another generation, but would still be a branch. 1.1.1 1.2.1
1.1.1 a first gen discipling the first first gen disciple. 
1.2.1 a first gen discipling a second gen who is the first second gen to be discipled. 1.2.1
1 First Gen disciple maker
2 gen placeholder (second)

Lord I am stressed. i know that you desire that I would follow you. I see that you are asking me to love you, and remain in your love, to love others and be loved by others, and to make disciples and to be discipled. I see this as something you desire. I often get stuck in my head. I am desiring LORD that there would be a movement of disciple makers who meet the qualifications above and are walking in a love relationship with you, others, and are making disciples. I need your help to do this. I need your hlep to launch any movements. I see it is your desire to see this happen in my lifetime. There are many people who will be saved, but the world needs to know you. They need to be reached in a way that sustains the gospel presence among the UPG's until all the UPG's are no longer Unreached. There will be a mighty shaking of the church and awakening of every simple church and small legacy church to the calling to reach the UPG's with the knowledge of the Glory of the LORD. I feel called to send out mail to all the churches in the United States of America. I would like to figure out how to do this and get funding so that every church could receive vision casting for the 1040 window and for their neighbors. I need your help to do this, and I trust that you will help me to do this. There is a mighty shaking that will happen across the west to wake up to the missional call to reach the UPGs with the gospel of JEsus Christ. May my life be an offering to you that is poured out like gasoline on the fire that is burning to see the nations reached for the LOVE of GOD to be satisfied with worshippers who are known and make him known publically. May we follow you until the day we die.

# `auth-js`

An isomorphic JavaScript client library for the [Supabase Auth](https://github.com/supabase/auth) API.

## Docs

- Using `auth-js`: https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup
- TypeDoc: https://supabase.github.io/auth-js/v2

## Quick start

Install

```bash
npm install --save @supabase/auth-js
```

Usage

```js
import { AuthClient } from '@supabase/auth-js'

const GOTRUE_URL = 'http://localhost:9999'

const auth = new AuthClient({ url: GOTRUE_URL })
```

- `signUp()`: https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup
- `signIn()`: https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin
- `signOut()`: https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout

### Custom `fetch` implementation

`auth-js` uses the [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) library to make HTTP requests, but an alternative `fetch` implementation can be provided as an option. This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible, for instance Cloudflare Workers:

```js
import { AuthClient } from '@supabase/auth-js'

const AUTH_URL = 'http://localhost:9999'

const auth = new AuthClient({ url: AUTH_URL, fetch: fetch })
```

<!-- /TOC -->

## Motivation

Instead of implementing `XMLHttpRequest` in Node.js to run browser-specific [Fetch polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch), why not go from native `http` to `fetch` API directly? Hence, `node-fetch`, minimal code for a `window.fetch` compatible API on Node.js runtime.

See Matt Andrews' [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) or Leonardo Quixada's [cross-fetch](https://github.com/lquixada/cross-fetch) for isomorphic usage (exports `node-fetch` for server-side, `whatwg-fetch` for client-side).

## Features

- Stay consistent with `window.fetch` API.
- Make conscious trade-off when following [WHATWG fetch spec][whatwg-fetch] and [stream spec](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/) implementation details, document known differences.
- Use native promise but allow substituting it with [insert your favorite promise library].
- Use native Node streams for body on both request and response.
- Decode content encoding (gzip/deflate) properly and convert string output (such as `res.text()` and `res.json()`) to UTF-8 automatically.
- Useful extensions such as timeout, redirect limit, response size limit, [explicit errors](ERROR-HANDLING.md) for troubleshooting.

## Difference from client-side fetch

- See [Known Differences](LIMITS.md) for details.
- If you happen to use a missing feature that `window.fetch` offers, feel free to open an issue.
- Pull requests are welcomed too!

## Installation

Current stable release (`2.x`)

```sh
$ npm install node-fetch
```

## Loading and configuring the module
We suggest you load the module via `require` until the stabilization of ES modules in node:
```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
```

If you are using a Promise library other than native, set it through `fetch.Promise`:
```js
const Bluebird = require('bluebird');

fetch.Promise = Bluebird;
```

## Common Usage

NOTE: The documentation below is up-to-date with `2.x` releases; see the [`1.x` readme](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/1.x/README.md), [changelog](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/1.x/CHANGELOG.md) and [2.x upgrade guide](UPGRADE-GUIDE.md) for the differences.

#### Plain text or HTML
```js
fetch('https://github.com/')
    .then(res => res.text())
    .then(body => console.log(body));
```

#### JSON

```js

fetch('https://api.github.com/users/github')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
```

#### Simple Post
```js
fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', { method: 'POST', body: 'a=1' })
    .then(res => res.json()) // expecting a json response
    .then(json => console.log(json));
```

#### Post with JSON

```js
const body = { a: 1 };

fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', {
        method: 'post',
        body:    JSON.stringify(body),
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
```

#### Post with form parameters
`URLSearchParams` is available in Node.js as of v7.5.0. See [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_class_urlsearchparams) for more usage methods.

NOTE: The `Content-Type` header is only set automatically to `x-www-form-urlencoded` when an instance of `URLSearchParams` is given as such:

```js
const { URLSearchParams } = require('url');

const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.append('a', 1);

fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', { method: 'POST', body: params })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
```

#### Handling exceptions
NOTE: 3xx-5xx responses are *NOT* exceptions and should be handled in `then()`; see the next section for more information.

Adding a catch to the fetch promise chain will catch *all* exceptions, such as errors originating from node core libraries, network errors and operational errors, which are instances of FetchError. See the [error handling document](ERROR-HANDLING.md)  for more details.

```js
fetch('https://domain.invalid/')
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

#### Handling client and server errors
It is common to create a helper function to check that the response contains no client (4xx) or server (5xx) error responses:

```js
function checkStatus(res) {
    if (res.ok) { // res.status >= 200 && res.status < 300
        return res;
    } else {
        throw MyCustomError(res.statusText);
    }
}

fetch('https://httpbin.org/status/400')
    .then(checkStatus)
    .then(res => console.log('will not get here...'))
```

## Advanced Usage

#### Streams
The "Node.js way" is to use streams when possible:

```js
fetch('https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png')
    .then(res => {
        const dest = fs.createWriteStream('./octocat.png');
        res.body.pipe(dest);
    });
```

In Node.js 14 you can also use async iterators to read `body`; however, be careful to catch
errors -- the longer a response runs, the more likely it is to encounter an error.

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const response = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/stream/3');
try {
	for await (const chunk of response.body) {
		console.dir(JSON.parse(chunk.toString()));
	}
} catch (err) {
	console.error(err.stack);
}
```

In Node.js 12 you can also use async iterators to read `body`; however, async iterators with streams
did not mature until Node.js 14, so you need to do some extra work to ensure you handle errors
directly from the stream and wait on it response to fully close.

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const read = async body => {
    let error;
    body.on('error', err => {
        error = err;
    });
    for await (const chunk of body) {
        console.dir(JSON.parse(chunk.toString()));
    }
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        body.on('close', () => {
            error ? reject(error) : resolve();
        });
    });
};
try {
    const response = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/stream/3');
    await read(response.body);
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err.stack);
}
```

#### Buffer
If you prefer to cache binary data in full, use buffer(). (NOTE: `buffer()` is a `node-fetch`-only API)

```js
const fileType = require('file-type');

fetch('https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png')
    .then(res => res.buffer())
    .then(buffer => fileType(buffer))
    .then(type => { /* ... */ });
```

#### Accessing Headers and other Meta data
```js
fetch('https://github.com/')
    .then(res => {
        console.log(res.ok);
        console.log(res.status);
        console.log(res.statusText);
        console.log(res.headers.raw());
        console.log(res.headers.get('content-type'));
    });
```

#### Extract Set-Cookie Header

Unlike browsers, you can access raw `Set-Cookie` headers manually using `Headers.raw()`. This is a `node-fetch` only API.

```js
fetch(url).then(res => {
    // returns an array of values, instead of a string of comma-separated values
    console.log(res.headers.raw()['set-cookie']);
});
```

#### Post data using a file stream

```js
const { createReadStream } = require('fs');

const stream = createReadStream('input.txt');

fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', { method: 'POST', body: stream })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
```

#### Post with form-data (detect multipart)

```js
const FormData = require('form-data');

const form = new FormData();
form.append('a', 1);

fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', { method: 'POST', body: form })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));

// OR, using custom headers
// NOTE: getHeaders() is non-standard API

const form = new FormData();
form.append('a', 1);

const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    body: form,
    headers: form.getHeaders()
}

fetch('https://httpbin.org/post', options)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json));
```

#### Request cancellation with AbortSignal

> NOTE: You may cancel streamed requests only on Node >= v8.0.0

You may cancel requests with `AbortController`. A suggested implementation is [`abort-controller`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/abort-controller).

An example of timing out a request after 150ms could be achieved as the following:

```js
import AbortController from 'abort-controller';

const controller = new AbortController();
const timeout = setTimeout(
  () => { controller.abort(); },
  150,
);

fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(
    data => {
      useData(data)
    },
    err => {
      if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
        // request was aborted
      }
    },
  )
  .finally(() => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
  });
```

See [test cases](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/test/test.js) for more examples.


## API

### fetch(url[, options])

- `url` A string representing the URL for fetching
- `options` [Options](#fetch-options) for the HTTP(S) request
- Returns: <code>Promise&lt;[Response](#class-response)&gt;</code>

Perform an HTTP(S) fetch.

`url` should be an absolute url, such as `https://example.com/`. A path-relative URL (`/file/under/root`) or protocol-relative URL (`//can-be-http-or-https.com/`) will result in a rejected `Promise`.

<a id="fetch-options"></a>
### Options

The default values are shown after each option key.

```js
{
    // These properties are part of the Fetch Standard
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {},        // request headers. format is the identical to that accepted by the Headers constructor (see below)
    body: null,         // request body. can be null, a string, a Buffer, a Blob, or a Node.js Readable stream
    redirect: 'follow', // set to `manual` to extract redirect headers, `error` to reject redirect
    signal: null,       // pass an instance of AbortSignal to optionally abort requests

    // The following properties are node-fetch extensions
    follow: 20,         // maximum redirect count. 0 to not follow redirect
    timeout: 0,         // req/res timeout in ms, it resets on redirect. 0 to disable (OS limit applies). Signal is recommended instead.
    compress: true,     // support gzip/deflate content encoding. false to disable
    size: 0,            // maximum response body size in bytes. 0 to disable
    agent: null         // http(s).Agent instance or function that returns an instance (see below)
}
```

##### Default Headers

If no values are set, the following request headers will be sent automatically:

Header              | Value
------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------
`Accept-Encoding`   | `gzip,deflate` _(when `options.compress === true`)_
`Accept`            | `*/*`
`Connection`        | `close` _(when no `options.agent` is present)_
`Content-Length`    | _(automatically calculated, if possible)_
`Transfer-Encoding` | `chunked` _(when `req.body` is a stream)_
`User-Agent`        | `node-fetch/1.0 (+https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch)`

Note: when `body` is a `Stream`, `Content-Length` is not set automatically.

##### Custom Agent

The `agent` option allows you to specify networking related options which are out of the scope of Fetch, including and not limited to the following:

- Support self-signed certificate
- Use only IPv4 or IPv6
- Custom DNS Lookup

See [`http.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_new_agent_options) for more information.

In addition, the `agent` option accepts a function that returns `http`(s)`.Agent` instance given current [URL](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html), this is useful during a redirection chain across HTTP and HTTPS protocol.

```js
const httpAgent = new http.Agent({
    keepAlive: true
});
const httpsAgent = new https.Agent({
    keepAlive: true
});

const options = {
    agent: function (_parsedURL) {
        if (_parsedURL.protocol == 'http:') {
            return httpAgent;
        } else {
            return httpsAgent;
        }
    }
}
```

<a id="class-request"></a>
### Class: Request

An HTTP(S) request containing information about URL, method, headers, and the body. This class implements the [Body](#iface-body) interface.

Due to the nature of Node.js, the following properties are not implemented at this moment:

- `type`
- `destination`
- `referrer`
- `referrerPolicy`
- `mode`
- `credentials`
- `cache`
- `integrity`
- `keepalive`

The following node-fetch extension properties are provided:

- `follow`
- `compress`
- `counter`
- `agent`

See [options](#fetch-options) for exact meaning of these extensions.

#### new Request(input[, options])

<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>

- `input` A string representing a URL, or another `Request` (which will be cloned)
- `options` [Options][#fetch-options] for the HTTP(S) request

Constructs a new `Request` object. The constructor is identical to that in the [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request).

In most cases, directly `fetch(url, options)` is simpler than creating a `Request` object.

<a id="class-response"></a>
### Class: Response

An HTTP(S) response. This class implements the [Body](#iface-body) interface.

The following properties are not implemented in node-fetch at this moment:

- `Response.error()`
- `Response.redirect()`
- `type`
- `trailer`

#### new Response([body[, options]])

<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>

- `body` A `String` or [`Readable` stream][node-readable]
- `options` A [`ResponseInit`][response-init] options dictionary

Constructs a new `Response` object. The constructor is identical to that in the [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response).

Because Node.js does not implement service workers (for which this class was designed), one rarely has to construct a `Response` directly.

#### response.ok

<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>

Convenience property representing if the request ended normally. Will evaluate to true if the response status was greater than or equal to 200 but smaller than 300.

#### response.redirected

<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>

Convenience property representing if the request has been redirected at least once. Will evaluate to true if the internal redirect counter is greater than 0.

<a id="class-headers"></a>
### Class: Headers

This class allows manipulating and iterating over a set of HTTP headers. All methods specified in the [Fetch Standard][whatwg-fetch] are implemented.

#### new Headers([init])

<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>

- `init` Optional argument to pre-fill the `Headers` object

Construct a new `Headers` object. `init` can be either `null`, a `Headers` object, an key-value map object or any iterable object.

```js
// Example adapted from https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#example-headers-class

const meta = {
  'Content-Type': 'text/xml',
  'Breaking-Bad': '<3'
};
const headers = new Headers(meta);

// The above is equivalent to
const meta = [
  [ 'Content-Type', 'text/xml' ],
  [ 'Breaking-Bad', '<3' ]
];
const headers = new Headers(meta);

// You can in fact use any iterable objects, like a Map or even another Headers
const meta = new Map();
meta.set('Content-Type', 'text/xml');
meta.set('Breaking-Bad', '<3');
const headers = new Headers(meta);
const copyOfHeaders = new Headers(headers);
```

<a id="iface-body"></a>
### Interface: Body

`Body` is an abstract interface with methods that are applicable to both `Request` and `Response` classes.

The following methods are not yet implemented in node-fetch at this moment:

- `formData()`

#### body.body

<small>*(deviation from spec)*</small>

* Node.js [`Readable` stream][node-readable]

Data are encapsulated in the `Body` object. Note that while the [Fetch Standard][whatwg-fetch] requires the property to always be a WHATWG `ReadableStream`, in node-fetch it is a Node.js [`Readable` stream][node-readable].

#### body.bodyUsed

<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>

* `Boolean`

A boolean property for if this body has been consumed. Per the specs, a consumed body cannot be used again.

#### body.arrayBuffer()
#### body.blob()
#### body.json()
#### body.text()

<small>*(spec-compliant)*</small>

* Returns: <code>Promise</code>

Consume the body and return a promise that will resolve to one of these formats.

#### body.buffer()

<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>

* Returns: <code>Promise&lt;Buffer&gt;</code>

Consume the body and return a promise that will resolve to a Buffer.

#### body.textConverted()

<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>

* Returns: <code>Promise&lt;String&gt;</code>

Identical to `body.text()`, except instead of always converting to UTF-8, encoding sniffing will be performed and text converted to UTF-8 if possible.

(This API requires an optional dependency of the npm package [encoding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/encoding), which you need to install manually. `webpack` users may see [a warning message](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/issues/412#issuecomment-379007792) due to this optional dependency.)

<a id="class-fetcherror"></a>
### Class: FetchError

<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>

An operational error in the fetching process. See [ERROR-HANDLING.md][] for more info.

<a id="class-aborterror"></a>
### Class: AbortError

<small>*(node-fetch extension)*</small>

An Error thrown when the request is aborted in response to an `AbortSignal`'s `abort` event. It has a `name` property of `AbortError`. See [ERROR-HANDLING.MD][] for more info.

# `postgrest-js`

[![Build](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)
[![Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@supabase/postgrest-js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@supabase/postgrest-js)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@supabase/postgrest-js)](#license)

Isomorphic JavaScript client for [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org). The goal of this library is to make an "ORM-like" restful interface.

Full documentation can be found [here](https://supabase.github.io/postgrest-js/v2).

### Quick start

Install

```bash
npm install @supabase/postgrest-js
```

Usage

```js
import { PostgrestClient } from '@supabase/postgrest-js'

const REST_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
const postgrest = new PostgrestClient(REST_URL)
```

- select(): https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select
- insert(): https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/insert
- update(): https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/update
- delete(): https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/delete

#### Custom `fetch` implementation

`postgrest-js` uses the [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) library to make HTTP requests, but an alternative `fetch` implementation can be provided as an option. This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible, for instance Cloudflare Workers:

```js
import { PostgrestClient } from '@supabase/postgrest-js'

const REST_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'
const postgrest = new PostgrestClient(REST_URL, {
  fetch: (...args) => fetch(...args),
})
```

# Overview

This client enables you to use the following Supabase Realtime's features:

- **Broadcast**: send ephemeral messages from client to clients with minimal latency. Use cases include sharing cursor positions between users.
- **Presence**: track and synchronize shared state across clients with the help of CRDTs. Use cases include tracking which users are currently viewing a specific webpage.
- **Postgres Change Data Capture (CDC)**: listen for changes in your PostgreSQL database and send them to clients.

# Usage

## Installing the Package

```bash
npm install @supabase/realtime-js
```

## Creating a Channel

```js
import { RealtimeClient } from '@supabase/realtime-js'

const client = new RealtimeClient(REALTIME_URL, {
  params: {
    apikey: API_KEY
  },
})

const channel = client.channel('test-channel', {})

channel.subscribe((status, err) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    console.log('Connected!')
  }

  if (status === 'CHANNEL_ERROR') {
    console.log(`There was an error subscribing to channel: ${err.message}`)
  }

  if (status === 'TIMED_OUT') {
    console.log('Realtime server did not respond in time.')
  }

  if (status === 'CLOSED') {
    console.log('Realtime channel was unexpectedly closed.')
  }
})
```

### Notes:

- `REALTIME_URL` is `'ws://localhost:4000/socket'` when developing locally and `'wss://<project_ref>.supabase.co/realtime/v1'` when connecting to your Supabase project.
- `API_KEY` is a JWT whose claims must contain `exp` and `role` (existing database role).
- Channel name can be any `string`.

## Broadcast

Your client can send and receive messages based on the `event`.

```js
// Setup...

const channel = client.channel('broadcast-test', { broadcast: { ack: false, self: false } })

channel.on('broadcast', { event: 'some-event' }, (payload) =>
  console.log(payload)
)

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    // Send message to other clients listening to 'broadcast-test' channel
    await channel.send({
      type: 'broadcast',
      event: 'some-event',
      payload: { hello: 'world' },
    })
  }
})
```

### Notes:

- Setting `ack` to `true` means that the `channel.send` promise will resolve once server replies with acknowledgement that it received the broadcast message request.
- Setting `self` to `true` means that the client will receive the broadcast message it sent out.

## Presence

Your client can track and sync state that's stored in the channel.

```js
// Setup...

const channel = client.channel(
  'presence-test',
  {
    config: {
      presence: {
        key: ''
      }
    }
  }
)

channel.on('presence', { event: 'sync' }, () => {
  console.log('Online users: ', channel.presenceState())
})

channel.on('presence', { event: 'join' }, ({ newPresences }) => {
  console.log('New users have joined: ', newPresences)
})

channel.on('presence', { event: 'leave' }, ({ leftPresences }) => {
  console.log('Users have left: ', leftPresences)
})

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    const status = await channel.track({ 'user_id': 1 })
    console.log(status)
  }
})
```

## Postgres CDC

Receive database changes on the client.

```js
// Setup...

const channel = client.channel('db-changes')

channel.on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public' }, (payload) => {
  console.log('All changes in public schema: ', payload)
})

channel.on('postgres_changes', { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'messages' }, (payload) => {
  console.log('All inserts in messages table: ', payload)
})

channel.on('postgres_changes', { event: 'UPDATE', schema: 'public', table: 'users', filter: 'username=eq.Realtime' }, (payload) => {
  console.log('All updates on users table when username is Realtime: ', payload)
})

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    console.log('Ready to receive database changes!')
  }
})
```

## Get All Channels

You can see all the channels that your client has instantiatied.

```js
// Setup...

client.getChannels()
```

## Cleanup

It is highly recommended that you clean up your channels after you're done with them.

- Remove a single channel

```js
// Setup...

const channel = client.channel('some-channel-to-remove')

channel.subscribe()

client.removeChannel(channel)
```

- Remove all channels

```js
// Setup...

const channel1 = client.channel('a-channel-to-remove')
const channel2 = client.channel('another-channel-to-remove')

channel1.subscribe()
channel2.subscribe()

client.removeAllChannels()
```

File: ./node_modules/@supabase/storage-js/README.md
# `storage-js`

JS Client library to interact with Supabase Storage.

- Documentation: https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/storage-createbucket

## Quick Start Guide

### Installing the module

```bash
npm install @supabase/storage-js
```

### Connecting to the storage backend

```js
import { StorageClient } from '@supabase/storage-js'

const STORAGE_URL = 'https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1'
const SERVICE_KEY = '<service_role>' //! service key, not anon key

const storageClient = new StorageClient(STORAGE_URL, {
  apikey: SERVICE_KEY,
  Authorization: `Bearer ${SERVICE_KEY}`,
})
```

### Handling resources

#### Handling Storage Buckets

- Create a new Storage bucket:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.createBucket(
    'test_bucket', // Bucket name (must be unique)
    { public: false } // Bucket options
  )
  ```

- Retrieve the details of an existing Storage bucket:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.getBucket('test_bucket')
  ```

- Update a new Storage bucket:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.updateBucket(
    'test_bucket', // Bucket name
    { public: false } // Bucket options
  )
  ```

- Remove all objects inside a single bucket:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.emptyBucket('test_bucket')
  ```

- Delete an existing bucket (a bucket can't be deleted with existing objects inside it):

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.deleteBucket('test_bucket')
  ```

- Retrieve the details of all Storage buckets within an existing project:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.listBuckets()
  ```

#### Handling Files

- Upload a file to an existing bucket:

  ```js
  const fileBody = ... // load your file here

  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').upload('path/to/file', fileBody)
  ```

  > Note:  
  > The path in `data.Key` is prefixed by the bucket ID and is not the value which should be passed to the `download` method in order to fetch the file.  
  > To fetch the file via the `download` method, use `data.path` and `data.bucketId` as follows:
  >
  > ```javascript
  > const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').upload('/folder/file.txt', fileBody)
  > // check for errors
  > const { data2, error2 } = await storageClient.from(data.bucketId).download(data.path)
  > ```

  > Note: The `upload` method also accepts a map of optional parameters. For a complete list see the [Supabase API reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload).

- Download a file from an exisiting bucket:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').download('path/to/file')
  ```

- List all the files within a bucket:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').list('folder')
  ```

  > Note: The `list` method also accepts a map of optional parameters. For a complete list see the [Supabase API reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-list).

- Replace an existing file at the specified path with a new one:

  ```js
  const fileBody = ... // load your file here

  const { data, error } = await storageClient
    .from('bucket')
    .update('path/to/file', fileBody)
  ```

  > Note: The `upload` method also accepts a map of optional parameters. For a complete list see the [Supabase API reference](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload).

- Move an existing file:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient
    .from('bucket')
    .move('old/path/to/file', 'new/path/to/file')
  ```

- Delete files within the same bucket:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('bucket').remove(['path/to/file'])
  ```

- Create signed URL to download file without requiring permissions:

  ```js
  const expireIn = 60

  const { data, error } = await storageClient
    .from('bucket')
    .createSignedUrl('path/to/file', expireIn)
  ```

- Retrieve URLs for assets in public buckets:

  ```js
  const { data, error } = await storageClient.from('public-bucket').getPublicUrl('path/to/file')
  ```

# `supabase-js` - Isomorphic JavaScript Client for Supabase.

- **Documentation:** https://supabase.com/docs/reference
- TypeDoc: https://supabase.github.io/supabase-js/v2/

## Usage

First of all, you need to install the library:

```sh
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

Then you're able to import the library and establish the connection with the database:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')
```

### UMD

You can use plain `<script>`s to import supabase-js from CDNs, like:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
```

or even:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>
```

Then you can use it from a global `supabase` variable:

```html
<script>
  const { createClient } = supabase
  const _supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')

  console.log('Supabase Instance: ', _supabase)
  // ...
</script>
```

### ESM

You can use `<script type="module">` to import supabase-js from CDNs, like:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { createClient } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js/+esm'
  const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')

  console.log('Supabase Instance: ', supabase)
  // ...
</script>
```


### Deno

You can use supabase-js in the Deno runtime via esm.sh:

```js
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'
```

### Custom `fetch` implementation

`supabase-js` uses the [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) library to make HTTP requests, but an alternative `fetch` implementation can be provided as an option. This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible, for instance Cloudflare Workers:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Provide a custom `fetch` implementation as an option
const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key', {
  global: {
    fetch: (...args) => fetch(...args),
  },
})
```

  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/commander-rb/commander).  
  [API documentation](http://tj.github.com/commander.js/)


## Installation

    $ npm install commander

## Option parsing

Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')
  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')
  .option('-b, --bbq-sauce', 'Add bbq sauce')
  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log('you ordered a pizza with:');
if (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');
if (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineapple');
if (program.bbqSauce) console.log('  - bbq');
console.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);
```

Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as "--template-engine" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.

Note that multi-word options starting with `--no` prefix negate the boolean value of the following word. For example, `--no-sauce` sets the value of `program.sauce` to false.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('commander');

program
  .option('--no-sauce', 'Remove sauce')
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log('you ordered a pizza');
if (program.sauce) console.log('  with sauce');
else console.log(' without sauce');
```

To get string arguments from options you will need to use angle brackets <> for required inputs or square brackets [] for optional inputs. 

e.g. ```.option('-m --myarg [myVar]', 'my super cool description')```

Then to access the input if it was passed in.

e.g. ```var myInput = program.myarg```

**NOTE**: If you pass a argument without using brackets the example above will return true and not the value passed in.


## Version option

Calling the `version` implicitly adds the `-V` and `--version` options to the command.
When either of these options is present, the command prints the version number and exits.

    $ ./examples/pizza -V
    0.0.1

If you want your program to respond to the `-v` option instead of the `-V` option, simply pass custom flags to the `version` method using the same syntax as the `option` method.

```js
program
  .version('0.0.1', '-v, --version')
```

The version flags can be named anything, but the long option is required.

## Command-specific options

You can attach options to a command.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

var program = require('commander');

program
  .command('rm <dir>')
  .option('-r, --recursive', 'Remove recursively')
  .action(function (dir, cmd) {
    console.log('remove ' + dir + (cmd.recursive ? ' recursively' : ''))
  })

program.parse(process.argv)
```

A command's options are validated when the command is used. Any unknown options will be reported as an error. However, if an action-based command does not define an action, then the options are not validated.

## Coercion

```js
function range(val) {
  return val.split('..').map(Number);
}

function list(val) {
  return val.split(',');
}

function collect(val, memo) {
  memo.push(val);
  return memo;
}

function increaseVerbosity(v, total) {
  return total + 1;
}

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .usage('[options] <file ...>')
  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)
  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)
  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)
  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)
  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')
  .option('-c, --collect [value]', 'A repeatable value', collect, [])
  .option('-v, --verbose', 'A value that can be increased', increaseVerbosity, 0)
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log(' int: %j', program.integer);
console.log(' float: %j', program.float);
console.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);
program.range = program.range || [];
console.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);
console.log(' list: %j', program.list);
console.log(' collect: %j', program.collect);
console.log(' verbosity: %j', program.verbose);
console.log(' args: %j', program.args);
```

## Regular Expression
```js
program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-s --size <size>', 'Pizza size', /^(large|medium|small)$/i, 'medium')
  .option('-d --drink [drink]', 'Drink', /^(coke|pepsi|izze)$/i)
  .parse(process.argv);

console.log(' size: %j', program.size);
console.log(' drink: %j', program.drink);
```

## Variadic arguments

 The last argument of a command can be variadic, and only the last argument.  To make an argument variadic you have to
 append `...` to the argument name.  Here is an example:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .command('rmdir <dir> [otherDirs...]')
  .action(function (dir, otherDirs) {
    console.log('rmdir %s', dir);
    if (otherDirs) {
      otherDirs.forEach(function (oDir) {
        console.log('rmdir %s', oDir);
      });
    }
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

 An `Array` is used for the value of a variadic argument.  This applies to `program.args` as well as the argument passed
 to your action as demonstrated above.

## Specify the argument syntax

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .arguments('<cmd> [env]')
  .action(function (cmd, env) {
     cmdValue = cmd;
     envValue = env;
  });

program.parse(process.argv);

if (typeof cmdValue === 'undefined') {
   console.error('no command given!');
   process.exit(1);
}
console.log('command:', cmdValue);
console.log('environment:', envValue || "no environment given");
```
Angled brackets (e.g. `<cmd>`) indicate required input. Square brackets (e.g. `[env]`) indicate optional input.

## Git-style sub-commands

```js
// file: ./examples/pm
var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .command('install [name]', 'install one or more packages')
  .command('search [query]', 'search with optional query')
  .command('list', 'list packages installed', {isDefault: true})
  .parse(process.argv);
```

When `.command()` is invoked with a description argument, no `.action(callback)` should be called to handle sub-commands, otherwise there will be an error. This tells commander that you're going to use separate executables for sub-commands, much like `git(1)` and other popular tools.  
The commander will try to search the executables in the directory of the entry script (like `./examples/pm`) with the name `program-command`, like `pm-install`, `pm-search`.

Options can be passed with the call to `.command()`. Specifying `true` for `opts.noHelp` will remove the subcommand from the generated help output. Specifying `true` for `opts.isDefault` will run the subcommand if no other subcommand is specified.

If the program is designed to be installed globally, make sure the executables have proper modes, like `755`.

### `--harmony`

You can enable `--harmony` option in two ways:
* Use `#! /usr/bin/env node --harmony` in the sub-commands scripts. Note some os version dont support this pattern.
* Use the `--harmony` option when call the command, like `node --harmony examples/pm publish`. The `--harmony` option will be preserved when spawning sub-command process.

## Automated --help

 The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:

```  
$ ./examples/pizza --help
Usage: pizza [options]

An application for pizzas ordering

Options:
  -h, --help           output usage information
  -V, --version        output the version number
  -p, --peppers        Add peppers
  -P, --pineapple      Add pineapple
  -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce
  -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]
  -C, --no-cheese      You do not want any cheese
```

## Custom help

 You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information
 by listening for "--help". Commander will automatically
 exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program
 does not execute causing undesired behaviors, for example
 in the following executable "stuff" will not output when
 `--help` is used.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

/**
 * Module dependencies.
 */

var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')
  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')
  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');

// must be before .parse() since
// node's emit() is immediate

program.on('--help', function(){
  console.log('')
  console.log('Examples:');
  console.log('  $ custom-help --help');
  console.log('  $ custom-help -h');
});

program.parse(process.argv);

console.log('stuff');
```

Yields the following help output when `node script-name.js -h` or `node script-name.js --help` are run:

```
Usage: custom-help [options]

Options:
  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
  -f, --foo      enable some foo
  -b, --bar      enable some bar
  -B, --baz      enable some baz

Examples:
  $ custom-help --help
  $ custom-help -h
```

## .outputHelp(cb)

Output help information without exiting.
Optional callback cb allows post-processing of help text before it is displayed.

If you want to display help by default (e.g. if no command was provided), you can use something like:

```js
var program = require('commander');
var colors = require('colors');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .command('getstream [url]', 'get stream URL')
  .parse(process.argv);

if (!process.argv.slice(2).length) {
  program.outputHelp(make_red);
}

function make_red(txt) {
  return colors.red(txt); //display the help text in red on the console
}
```

## .help(cb)

  Output help information and exit immediately.
  Optional callback cb allows post-processing of help text before it is displayed.


## Custom event listeners
 You can execute custom actions by listening to command and option events.

```js
program.on('option:verbose', function () {
  process.env.VERBOSE = this.verbose;
});

// error on unknown commands
program.on('command:*', function () {
  console.error('Invalid command: %s\nSee --help for a list of available commands.', program.args.join(' '));
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Examples

```js
var program = require('commander');

program
  .version('0.1.0')
  .option('-C, --chdir <path>', 'change the working directory')
  .option('-c, --config <path>', 'set config path. defaults to ./deploy.conf')
  .option('-T, --no-tests', 'ignore test hook');

program
  .command('setup [env]')
  .description('run setup commands for all envs')
  .option("-s, --setup_mode [mode]", "Which setup mode to use")
  .action(function(env, options){
    var mode = options.setup_mode || "normal";
    env = env || 'all';
    console.log('setup for %s env(s) with %s mode', env, mode);
  });

program
  .command('exec <cmd>')
  .alias('ex')
  .description('execute the given remote cmd')
  .option("-e, --exec_mode <mode>", "Which exec mode to use")
  .action(function(cmd, options){
    console.log('exec "%s" using %s mode', cmd, options.exec_mode);
  }).on('--help', function() {
    console.log('');
    console.log('Examples:');
    console.log('');
    console.log('  $ deploy exec sequential');
    console.log('  $ deploy exec async');
  });

program
  .command('*')
  .action(function(env){
    console.log('deploying "%s"', env);
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

# Changes in D3 4.0

D3 4.0 is modular. Instead of one library, D3 is now [many small libraries](#table-of-contents) that are designed to work together. You can pick and choose which parts to use as you see fit. Each library is maintained in its own repository, allowing decentralized ownership and independent release cycles. The default bundle combines about thirty of these microlibraries.

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
```

As before, you can load optional plugins on top of the default bundle, such as [ColorBrewer scales](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic):

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-scale-chromatic.v0.3.js"></script>
```

You are not required to use the default bundle! If youre just using [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection), use it as a standalone library. Like the default bundle, you can load D3 microlibraries using vanilla script tags or RequireJS (great for HTTP/2!):

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.js"></script>
```

You can also `cat` D3 microlibraries into a custom bundle, or use tools such as [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) to create [optimized bundles](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/bb09af4c39c79cffcde4). Custom bundles are great for applications that use a subset of D3s features; for example, a React chart library might use D3 for scales and shapes, and React to manipulate the DOM. The D3 microlibraries are written as [ES6 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), and Rollup lets you pick at the symbol level to produce smaller bundles.

Small files are nice, but modularity is also about making D3 more *fun*. Microlibraries are easier to understand, develop and test. They make it easier for new people to get involved and contribute. They reduce the distinction between a core module and a plugin, and increase the pace of development in D3 features.

If you dont care about modularity, you can mostly ignore this change and keep using the default bundle. However, there is one unavoidable consequence of adopting ES6 modules: every symbol in D3 4.0 now shares a flat namespace rather than the nested one of D3 3.x. For example, d3.scale.linear is now d3.scaleLinear, and d3.layout.treemap is now d3.treemap. The adoption of ES6 modules also means that D3 is now written exclusively in [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) and has better readability. And there have been many other significant improvements to D3s features! (Nearly all of the code from D3 3.x has been rewritten.) These changes are covered below.

### Other Global Changes

The default [UMD bundle](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) is now [anonymous](https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs/wiki/Updating-existing-libraries#register-as-an-anonymous-module-). No `d3` global is exported if AMD or CommonJS is detected. In a vanilla environment, the D3 microlibraries share the `d3` global, even if you load them independently; thus, code you write is the same whether or not you use the default bundle. (See [Lets Make a (D3) Plugin](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/d3-plugin/) for more.) The generated bundle is no longer stored in the Git repository; Bower has been repointed to [d3-bower](https://github.com/mbostock-bower/d3-bower), and you can find the generated files on [npm](https://unpkg.com/d3) or attached to the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/latest). The non-minified default bundle is no longer mangled, making it more readable and preserving inline comments.

To the consternation of some users, 3.x employed Unicode variable names such as , ,  and  for a concise representation of mathematical operations. A downside of this approach was that a SyntaxError would occur if you loaded the non-minified D3 using ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8. 3.x also used Unicode string literals, such as the SI-prefix  for 1e-6. 4.0 uses only ASCII variable names and ASCII string literals (see [rollup-plugin-ascii](https://github.com/mbostock/rollup-plugin-ascii)), avoiding encoding problems.

## [Arrays (d3-array)](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md)

The new [d3.scan](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#scan) method performs a linear scan of an array, returning the index of the least element according to the specified comparator. This is similar to [d3.min](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#min) and [d3.max](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#max), except you can use it to find the position of an extreme element, rather than just calculate an extreme value.

```js
var data = [
  {name: "Alice", value: 2},
  {name: "Bob", value: 3},
  {name: "Carol", value: 1},
  {name: "Dwayne", value: 5}
];

var i = d3.scan(data, function(a, b) { return a.value - b.value; }); // 2
data[i]; // {name: "Carol", value: 1}
```

The new [d3.ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#ticks) and [d3.tickStep](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#tickStep) methods are useful for generating human-readable numeric ticks. These methods are a low-level alternative to [*continuous*.ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_ticks) from [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale). The new implementation is also more accurate, returning the optimal number of ticks as measured by relative error.

```js
var ticks = d3.ticks(0, 10, 5); // [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

The [d3.range](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#range) method no longer makes an elaborate attempt to avoid floating-point error when *step* is not an integer. The returned values are strictly defined as *start* + *i* \* *step*, where *i* is an integer. (Learn more about [floating point math](http://0.30000000000000004.com/).) d3.range returns the empty array for infinite ranges, rather than throwing an error.

The method signature for optional accessors has been changed to be more consistent with array methods such as [*array*.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach): the accessor is passed the current element (*d*), the index (*i*), and the array (*data*), with *this* as undefined. This affects [d3.min](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#min), [d3.max](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#max), [d3.extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#extent), [d3.sum](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#sum), [d3.mean](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#mean), [d3.median](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#median), [d3.quantile](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantile), [d3.variance](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#variance) and [d3.deviation](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#deviation). The [d3.quantile](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#quantile) method previously did not take an accessor. Some methods with optional arguments now treat those arguments as missing if they are null or undefined, rather than strictly checking arguments.length.

The new [d3.histogram](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#histograms) API replaces d3.layout.histogram. Rather than exposing *bin*.x and *bin*.dx on each returned bin, the histogram exposes *bin*.x0 and *bin*.x1, guaranteeing that *bin*.x0 is exactly equal to *bin*.x1 on the preceeding bin. The frequency and probability modes are no longer supported; each bin is simply an array of elements from the input data, so *bin*.length is equal to D3 3.xs *bin*.y in frequency mode. To compute a probability distribution, divide the number of elements in each bin by the total number of elements.

The *histogram*.range method has been renamed [*histogram*.domain](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#histogram_domain) for consistency with scales. The *histogram*.bins method has been renamed [*histogram*.thresholds](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#histogram_thresholds), and no longer accepts an upper value: *n* thresholds will produce *n* + 1 bins. If you specify a desired number of bins rather than thresholds, d3.histogram now uses [d3.ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#ticks) to compute nice bin thresholds. In addition to the default Sturges formula, D3 now implements the [Freedman-Diaconis rule](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#thresholdFreedmanDiaconis) and [Scotts normal reference rule](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#thresholdScott).

## [Axes (d3-axis)](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md)

To render axes properly in D3 3.x, you needed to style them:

```html
<style>

.axis path,
.axis line {
  fill: none;
  stroke: #000;
  shape-rendering: crispEdges;
}

.axis text {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
}

</style>
<script>

d3.select(".axis")
    .call(d3.svg.axis()
        .scale(x)
        .orient("bottom"));

</script>
```

If you didnt, you saw this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3/master/img/axis-v3.png" width="100%" height="105">

D3 4.0 provides default styles and shorter syntax. In place of d3.svg.axis and *axis*.orient, D3 4.0 now provides four constructors for each orientation: [d3.axisTop](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axisTop), [d3.axisRight](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axisRight), [d3.axisBottom](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axisBottom), [d3.axisLeft](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axisLeft). These constructors accept a scale, so you can reduce all of the above to:

```html
<script>

d3.select(".axis")
    .call(d3.axisBottom(x));

</script>
```

And get this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3/master/img/axis-v4.png" width="100%" height="105">

As before, you can customize the axis appearance either by applying stylesheets or by modifying the axis elements. The default appearance has been changed slightly to offset the axis by a half-pixel;  this fixes a crisp-edges rendering issue on Safari where the axis would be drawn two-pixels thick.

Theres now an [*axis*.tickArguments](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axis_tickArguments) method, as an alternative to [*axis*.ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axis_ticks) that also allows the axis tick arguments to be inspected. The [*axis*.tickSize](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axis_tickSize) method has been changed to only allow a single argument when setting the tick size. The *axis*.innerTickSize and *axis*.outerTickSize methods have been renamed [*axis*.tickSizeInner](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axis_tickSizeInner) and [*axis*.tickSizeOuter](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/README.md#axis_tickSizeOuter), respectively.

## [Brushes (d3-brush)](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md)

Replacing d3.svg.brush, there are now three classes of brush for brushing along the *x*-dimension, the *y*-dimension, or both: [d3.brushX](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brushX), [d3.brushY](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brushY), [d3.brush](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brush). Brushes are no longer dependent on [scales](#scales-d3-scale); instead, each brush defines a selection in screen coordinates. This selection can be [inverted](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_invert) if you want to compute the corresponding data domain. And rather than rely on the scalesranges to determine the brushable area, there is now a [*brush*.extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brush_extent) method for setting it. If you do not set the brush extent, it defaults to the full extent of the owner SVG element. The *brush*.clamp method has also been eliminated; brushing is always restricted to the brushable area defined by the brush extent.

Brushes no longer store the active brush selection (*i.e.*, the highlighted region; the brushs position) internally. The brushs position is now stored on any elements to which the brush has been applied. The brushs position is available as *event*.selection within a brush event or by calling [d3.brushSelection](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brushSelection) on a given *element*. To move the brush programmatically, use [*brush*.move](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brush_move) with a given [selection](#selections-d3-selection) or [transition](#transitions-d3-transition); see the [brush snapping example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6232537). The *brush*.event method has been removed.

Brush interaction has been improved. By default, brushes now ignore right-clicks intended for the context menu; you can change this behavior using [*brush*.filter](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brush_filter). Brushes also ignore emulated mouse events on iOS. Holding down SHIFT () while brushing locks the *x*- or *y*-position of the brush. Holding down META () while clicking and dragging starts a new selection, rather than translating the existing selection.

The default appearance of the brush has also been improved and slightly simplified. Previously it was necessary to apply styles to the brush to give it a reasonable appearance, such as:

```css
.brush .extent {
  stroke: #fff;
  fill-opacity: .125;
  shape-rendering: crispEdges;
}
```

These styles are now applied by default as attributes; if you want to customize the brush appearance, you can still apply external styles or modify the brush elements. (D3 4.0 features a similar improvement to [axes](#axes-d3-axis).) A new [*brush*.handleSize](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/README.md#brush_handleSize) method lets you override the brush handle size; it defaults to six pixels.

The brush now consumes handled events, making it easier to combine with other interactive behaviors such as [dragging](#dragging-d3-drag) and [zooming](#zooming-d3-zoom). The *brushstart* and *brushend* events have been renamed to *start* and *end*, respectively. The brush event no longer reports a *event*.mode to distinguish between resizing and dragging the brush.

## [Chords (d3-chord)](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening:

* d3.layout.chord  [d3.chord](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/README.md#chord)
* d3.svg.chord  [d3.ribbon](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/README.md#ribbon)

For consistency with [*arc*.padAngle](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#arc_padAngle), *chord*.padding has also been renamed to [*ribbon*.padAngle](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/README.md#ribbon_padAngle). A new [*ribbon*.context](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/README.md#ribbon_context) method lets you render chord diagrams to Canvas! See also [d3-path](#paths-d3-path).

## [Collections (d3-collection)](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md)

The [d3.set](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#set) constructor now accepts an existing set for making a copy. If you pass an array to d3.set, you can also pass a value accessor. This accessor takes the standard arguments: the current element (*d*), the index (*i*), and the array (*data*), with *this* undefined. For example:

```js
var yields = [
  {yield: 22.13333, variety: "Manchuria",        year: 1932, site: "Grand Rapids"},
  {yield: 26.76667, variety: "Peatland",         year: 1932, site: "Grand Rapids"},
  {yield: 28.10000, variety: "No. 462",          year: 1931, site: "Duluth"},
  {yield: 38.50000, variety: "Svansota",         year: 1932, site: "Waseca"},
  {yield: 40.46667, variety: "Svansota",         year: 1931, site: "Crookston"},
  {yield: 36.03333, variety: "Peatland",         year: 1932, site: "Waseca"},
  {yield: 34.46667, variety: "Wisconsin No. 38", year: 1931, site: "Grand Rapids"}
];

var sites = d3.set(yields, function(d) { return d.site; }); // Grand Rapids, Duluth, Waseca, Crookston
```

The [d3.map](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#map) constructor also follows the standard array accessor argument pattern.

The *map*.forEach and *set*.forEach methods have been renamed to [*map*.each](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#map_each) and [*set*.each](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#set_each) respectively. The order of arguments for *map*.each has also been changed to *value*, *key* and *map*, while the order of arguments for *set*.each is now *value*, *value* and *set*. This is closer to ES6 [*map*.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/forEach) and [*set*.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/forEach). Also like ES6 Map and Set, *map*.set and *set*.add now return the current collection (rather than the added value) to facilitate method chaining. New [*map*.clear](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#map_clear) and [*set*.clear](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#set_clear) methods can be used to empty collections.

The [*nest*.map](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#nest_map) method now always returns a d3.map instance. For a plain object, use [*nest*.object](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#nest_object) instead. When used in conjunction with [*nest*.rollup](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#nest_rollup), [*nest*.entries](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/README.md#nest_entries) now returns {key, value} objects for the leaf entries, instead of {key, values}. This makes *nest*.rollup easier to use in conjunction with [hierarchies](#hierarchies-d3-hierarchy), as in this [Nest Treemap example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2838bf53e0e65f369f476afd653663a2).

## [Colors (d3-color)](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md)

All colors now have opacity exposed as *color*.opacity, which is a number in [0, 1]. You can pass an optional opacity argument to the color space constructors [d3.rgb](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#rgb), [d3.hsl](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#hsl), [d3.lab](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#lab), [d3.hcl](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#hcl) or [d3.cubehelix](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#cubehelix).

You can now parse rgba() and hsla() CSS color specifiers or the string transparent using [d3.color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#color). The transparent color is defined as an RGB color with zero opacity and undefined red, green and blue channels; this differs slightly from CSS which defines it as transparent black, but is useful for simplifying color interpolation logic where either the starting or ending color has undefined channels. The [*color*.toString](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#color_toString) method now likewise returns an rgb() or rgba() string with integer channel values, not the hexadecimal RGB format, consistent with CSS computed values. This improves performance by short-circuiting transitions when the elements starting style matches its ending style.

The new [d3.color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#color) method is the primary method for parsing colors: it returns a d3.color instance in the appropriate color space, or null if the CSS color specifier is invalid. For example:

```js
var red = d3.color("hsl(0, 80%, 50%)"); // {h: 0, l: 0.5, s: 0.8, opacity: 1}
```

The parsing implementation is now more robust. For example, you can no longer mix integers and percentages in rgb(), and it correctly handles whitespace, decimal points, number signs, and other edge cases. The color space constructors d3.rgb, d3.hsl, d3.lab, d3.hcl and d3.cubehelix now always return a copy of the input color, converted to the corresponding color space. While [*color*.rgb](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#color_rgb) remains, *rgb*.hsl has been removed; use d3.hsl to convert a color to the RGB color space.

The RGB color space no longer greedily quantizes and clamps channel values when creating colors, improving accuracy in color space conversion. Quantization and clamping now occurs in *color*.toString when formatting a color for display. You can use the new [*color*.displayable](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#color_displayable) to test whether a color is [out-of-gamut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut).

The [*rgb*.brighter](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#rgb_brighter) method no longer special-cases black. This is a multiplicative operator, defining a new color *r*, *g*, *b* where *r* = *r*  *pow*(0.7, *k*), *g* = *g*  *pow*(0.7, *k*) and *b* = *b*  *pow*(0.7, *k*); a brighter black is still black.

Theres a new [d3.cubehelix](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/README.md#cubehelix) color space, generalizing Dave Greens color scheme! (See also [d3.interpolateCubehelixDefault](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateCubehelixDefault) from [d3-scale](#scales-d3-scale).) You can continue to define your own custom color spaces, too; see [d3-hsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-hsv) for an example.

## [Dispatches (d3-dispatch)](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/README.md)

Rather than decorating the *dispatch* object with each event type, the dispatch object now exposes generic [*dispatch*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/README.md#dispatch_call) and [*dispatch*.apply](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/README.md#dispatch_apply) methods which take the *type* string as the first argument. For example, in D3 3.x, you might say:

```js
dispatcher.foo.call(that, "Hello, Foo!");
```

To dispatch a *foo* event in D3 4.0, youd say:

```js
dispatcher.call("foo", that, "Hello, Foo!");
```

The [*dispatch*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/README.md#dispatch_on) method now accepts multiple typenames, allowing you to add or remove listeners for multiple events simultaneously. For example, to send both *foo* and *bar* events to the same listener:

```js
dispatcher.on("foo bar", function(message) {
  console.log(message);
});
```

This matches the new behavior of [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_on) in [d3-selection](#selections-d3-selection). The *dispatch*.on method now validates that the specifier *listener* is a function, rather than throwing an error in the future.

The new implementation d3.dispatch is faster, using fewer closures to improve performance. Theres also a new [*dispatch*.copy](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/README.md#dispatch_copy) method for making a copy of a dispatcher; this is used by [d3-transition](#transitions-d3-transition) to improve the performance of transitions in the common case where all elements in a transition have the same transition event listeners.

## [Dragging (d3-drag)](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md)

The drag behavior d3.behavior.drag has been renamed to d3.drag. The *drag*.origin method has been replaced by [*drag*.subject](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md#drag_subject), which allows you to define the thing being dragged at the start of a drag gesture. This is particularly useful with Canvas, where draggable objects typically share a Canvas element (as opposed to SVG, where draggable objects typically have distinct DOM elements); see the [circle dragging example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/444757cc9f0fde320a5f469cd36860f4).

A new [*drag*.container](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md#drag_container) method lets you override the parent element that defines the drag gesture coordinate system. This defaults to the parent node of the element to which the drag behavior was applied. For dragging on Canvas elements, you probably want to use the Canvas element as the container.

[Drag events](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md#drag-events) now expose an [*event*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md#event_on) method for registering temporary listeners for duration of the current drag gesture; these listeners can capture state for the current gesture, such as the thing being dragged. A new *event*.active property lets you detect whether multiple (multitouch) drag gestures are active concurrently. The *dragstart* and *dragend* events have been renamed to *start* and *end*. By default, drag behaviors now ignore right-clicks intended for the context menu; use [*drag*.filter](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md#drag_filter) to control which events are ignored. The drag behavior also ignores emulated mouse events on iOS. The drag behavior now consumes handled events, making it easier to combine with other interactive behaviors such as [zooming](#zooming-d3-zoom).

The new [d3.dragEnable](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md#dragEnable) and [d3.dragDisable](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/README.md#dragDisable) methods provide a low-level API for implementing drag gestures across browsers and devices. These methods are also used by other D3 components, such as the [brush](#brushes-d3-brush).

## [Delimiter-Separated Values (d3-dsv)](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening, various CSV and TSV methods have new names:

* d3.csv.parse  [d3.csvParse](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#csvParse)
* d3.csv.parseRows  [d3.csvParseRows](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#csvParseRows)
* d3.csv.format  [d3.csvFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#csvFormat)
* d3.csv.formatRows  [d3.csvFormatRows](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#csvFormatRows)
* d3.tsv.parse  [d3.tsvParse](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#tsvParse)
* d3.tsv.parseRows  [d3.tsvParseRows](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#tsvParseRows)
* d3.tsv.format  [d3.tsvFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#tsvFormat)
* d3.tsv.formatRows  [d3.tsvFormatRows](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#tsvFormatRows)

The [d3.csv](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#csv) and [d3.tsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#tsv) methods for loading files of the corresponding formats have not been renamed, however! Those are defined in [d3-request](#requests-d3-request).Theres no longer a d3.dsv method, which served the triple purpose of defining a DSV formatter, a DSV parser and a DSV requestor; instead, theres just [d3.dsvFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#dsvFormat) which you can use to define a DSV formatter and parser. You can use [*request*.response](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#request_response) to make a request and then parse the response body, or just use [d3.text](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#text).

The [*dsv*.parse](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#dsv_parse) method now exposes the column names and their input order as *data*.columns. For example:

```js
d3.csv("cars.csv", function(error, data) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log(data.columns); // ["Year", "Make", "Model", "Length"]
});
```

You can likewise pass an optional array of column names to [*dsv*.format](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#dsv_format) to format only a subset of columns, or to specify the column order explicitly:

```js
var string = d3.csvFormat(data, ["Year", "Model", "Length"]);
```

The parser is a bit faster and the formatter is a bit more robust: inputs are coerced to strings before formatting, fixing an obscure crash, and deprecated support for falling back to [*dsv*.formatRows](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/README.md#dsv_formatRows) when the input *data* is an array of arrays has been removed.

## [Easings (d3-ease)](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md)

D3 3.x used strings, such as cubic-in-out, to identify easing methods; these strings could be passed to d3.ease or *transition*.ease. D3 4.0 uses symbols instead, such as [d3.easeCubicInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCubicInOut). Symbols are simpler and cleaner. They work well with Rollup to produce smaller custom bundles. You can still define your own custom easing function, too, if desired. Heres the full list of equivalents:

* linear  [d3.easeLinear](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeLinear)
* linear-in  [d3.easeLinear](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeLinear)
* linear-out  [d3.easeLinear](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeLinear)
* linear-in-out  [d3.easeLinear](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeLinear)
* linear-out-in  [d3.easeLinear](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeLinear)
* poly-in  [d3.easePolyIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easePolyIn)
* poly-out  [d3.easePolyOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easePolyOut)
* poly-in-out  [d3.easePolyInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easePolyInOut)
* poly-out-in  REMOVED
* quad-in  [d3.easeQuadIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeQuadIn)
* quad-out  [d3.easeQuadOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeQuadOut)
* quad-in-out  [d3.easeQuadInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeQuadInOut)
* quad-out-in  REMOVED
* cubic-in  [d3.easeCubicIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCubicIn)
* cubic-out  [d3.easeCubicOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCubicOut)
* cubic-in-out  [d3.easeCubicInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCubicInOut)
* cubic-out-in  REMOVED
* sin-in  [d3.easeSinIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeSinIn)
* sin-out  [d3.easeSinOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeSinOut)
* sin-in-out  [d3.easeSinInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeSinInOut)
* sin-out-in  REMOVED
* exp-in  [d3.easeExpIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeExpIn)
* exp-out  [d3.easeExpOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeExpOut)
* exp-in-out  [d3.easeExpInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeExpInOut)
* exp-out-in  REMOVED
* circle-in  [d3.easeCircleIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCircleIn)
* circle-out  [d3.easeCircleOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCircleOut)
* circle-in-out  [d3.easeCircleInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCircleInOut)
* circle-out-in  REMOVED
* elastic-in  [d3.easeElasticOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeElasticOut)
* elastic-out  [d3.easeElasticIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeElasticIn)
* elastic-in-out  REMOVED
* elastic-out-in  [d3.easeElasticInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeElasticInOut)
* back-in  [d3.easeBackIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeBackIn)
* back-out  [d3.easeBackOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeBackOut)
* back-in-out  [d3.easeBackInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeBackInOut)
* back-out-in  REMOVED
* bounce-in  [d3.easeBounceOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeBounceOut)
* bounce-out  [d3.easeBounceIn](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeBounceIn)
* bounce-in-out  REMOVED
* bounce-out-in  [d3.easeBounceInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeBounceInOut)

 The -in, -out and -in-out variants of linear easing are identical, so theres just d3.easeLinear.
<br> Elastic and bounce easing were inadvertently reversed in 3.x, so 4.0 eliminates -out-in easing!

For convenience, there are also default aliases for each easing method. For example, [d3.easeCubic](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCubic) is an alias for [d3.easeCubicInOut](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeCubicInOut). Most default to -in-out; the exceptionsare [d3.easeBounce](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeBounce) and [d3.easeElastic](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#easeElastic), which default to -out.

Rather than pass optional arguments to d3.ease or *transition*.ease, parameterizable easing functions now have named parameters: [*poly*.exponent](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#poly_exponent), [*elastic*.amplitude](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#elastic_amplitude), [*elastic*.period](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#elastic_period) and [*back*.overshoot](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md#back_overshoot). For example, in D3 3.x you might say:

```js
var e = d3.ease("elastic-out-in", 1.2);
```

The equivalent in D3 4.0 is:

```js
var e = d3.easeElastic.amplitude(1.2);
```

Many of the easing functions have been optimized for performance and accuracy. Several bugs have been fixed, as well, such as the interpretation of the overshoot parameter for back easing, and the period parameter for elastic easing. Also, [d3-transition](#transitions-d3-transition) now explicitly guarantees that the last tick of the transition happens at exactly *t* = 1, avoiding floating point errors in some easing functions.

Theres now a nice [visual reference](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/blob/master/README.md) and an [animated reference](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/248bac3b8e354a9103c4) to the new easing functions, too!

## [Forces (d3-force)](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md)

The force layout d3.layout.force has been renamed to d3.forceSimulation. The force simulation now uses [velocity Verlet integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration#Velocity_Verlet) rather than position Verlet, tracking the nodes positions (*node*.x, *node*.y) and velocities (*node*.vx, *node*.vy) rather than their previous positions (*node*.px, *node*.py).

Rather than hard-coding a set of built-in forces, the force simulation is now extensible: you specify which forces you want! The approach affords greater flexibility through composition. The new forces are more flexible, too: force parameters can typically be configured per-node or per-link. There are separate positioning forces for [*x*](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceX) and [*y*](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceY) that replace *force*.gravity; [*x*.x](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#x_x) and [*y*.y](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#y_y) replace *force*.size. The new [link force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceLink) replaces *force*.linkStrength and employs better default heuristics to improve stability. The new [many-body force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceManyBody) replaces *force*.charge and supports a new [minimum-distance parameter](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#manyBody_distanceMin) and performance improvements thanks to 4.0s [new quadtrees](#quadtrees-d3-quadtree). There are also brand-new forces for [centering nodes](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceCenter) and [collision resolution](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceCollision).

The new forces and simulation have been carefully crafted to avoid nondeterminism. Rather than initializing nodes randomly, if the nodes do not have preset positions, they are placed in a phyllotaxis pattern:

<img alt="Phyllotaxis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-force/master/img/phyllotaxis.png" width="420" height="219">

Random jitter is still needed to resolve link, collision and many-body forces if there are coincident nodes, but at least in the common case, the force simulation (and the resulting force-directed graph layout) is now consistent across browsers and reloads. D3 no longer plays dice!

The force simulation has several new methods for greater control over heating, such as [*simulation*.alphaMin](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_alphaMin) and [*simulation*.alphaDecay](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_alphaDecay), and the internal timer. Calling [*simulation*.alpha](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_alpha) now has no effect on the internal timer, which is controlled independently via [*simulation*.stop](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_stop) and [*simulation*.restart](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_restart). The force layouts internal timer now starts automatically on creation, removing *force*.start. As in 3.x, you can advance the simulation manually using [*simulation*.tick](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_tick). The *force*.friction parameter is replaced by *simulation*.velocityDecay. A new [*simulation*.alphaTarget](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_alphaTarget) method allows you to set the desired alpha (temperature) of the simulation, such that the simulation can be smoothly reheated during interaction, and then smoothly cooled again. This improves the stability of the graph during interaction.

The force layout no longer depends on the [drag behavior](#dragging-d3-drag), though you can certainly create [draggable force-directed graphs](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048)! Set *node*.fx and *node*.fy to fix a nodes position. As an alternative to a [Voronoi](#voronoi-d3-voronoi) SVG overlay, you can now use [*simulation*.find](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_find) to find the closest node to a pointer.

## [Number Formats (d3-format)](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md)

If a precision is not specified, the formatting behavior has changed: there is now a default precision of 6 for all directives except *none*, which defaults to 12. In 3.x, if you did not specify a precision, the number was formatted using its shortest unique representation (per [*number*.toString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toString)); this could lead to unexpected digits due to [floating point math](http://0.30000000000000004.com/). The new default precision in 4.0 produces more consistent results:

```js
var f = d3.format("e");
f(42);        // "4.200000e+1"
f(0.1 + 0.2); // "3.000000e-1"
```

To trim insignificant trailing zeroes, use the *none* directive, which is similar `g`. For example:

```js
var f = d3.format(".3");
f(0.12345);   // "0.123"
f(0.10000);   // "0.1"
f(0.1 + 0.2); // "0.3"
```

Under the hood, number formatting has improved accuracy with very large and very small numbers by using [*number*.toExponential](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toExponential) rather than [Math.log](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/log) to extract the mantissa and exponent. Negative zero (-0, an IEEE 754 construct) and very small numbers that round to zero are now formatted as unsigned zero. The inherently unsafe d3.round method has been removed, along with d3.requote.

The [d3.formatPrefix](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#formatPrefix) method has been changed. Rather than returning an SI-prefix string, it returns an SI-prefix format function for a given *specifier* and reference *value*. For example, to format thousands:

```js
var f = d3.formatPrefix(",.0", 1e3);
f(1e3); // "1k"
f(1e4); // "10k"
f(1e5); // "100k"
f(1e6); // "1,000k"
```

Unlike the `s` format directive, d3.formatPrefix always employs the same SI-prefix, producing consistent results:

```js
var f = d3.format(".0s");
f(1e3); // "1k"
f(1e4); // "10k"
f(1e5); // "100k"
f(1e6); // "1M"
```

The new `(` sign option uses parentheses for negative values. This is particularly useful in conjunction with `$`. For example:

```js
d3.format("+.0f")(-42);  // "-42"
d3.format("(.0f")(-42);  // "(42)"
d3.format("+$.0f")(-42); // "-$42"
d3.format("($.0f")(-42); // "($42)"
```

The new `=` align option places any sign and symbol to the left of any padding:

```js
d3.format(">6d")(-42);  // "   -42"
d3.format("=6d")(-42);  // "-   42"
d3.format(">(6d")(-42); // "  (42)"
d3.format("=(6d")(-42); // "(  42)"
```

The `b`, `o`, `d` and `x` directives now round to the nearest integer, rather than returning the empty string for non-integers:

```js
d3.format("b")(41.9); // "101010"
d3.format("o")(41.9); // "52"
d3.format("d")(41.9); // "42"
d3.format("x")(41.9); // "2a"
```

The `c` directive is now for character data (*i.e.*, literal strings), not for character codes. The is useful if you just want to apply padding and alignment and dont care about formatting numbers. For example, the infamous [left-pad](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm) (as well as center- and right-pad!) can be conveniently implemented as:

```js
d3.format(">10c")("foo"); // "       foo"
d3.format("^10c")("foo"); // "   foo    "
d3.format("<10c")("foo"); // "foo       "
```

There are several new methods for computing suggested decimal precisions; these are used by [d3-scale](#scales-d3-scale) for tick formatting, and are helpful for implementing custom number formats: [d3.precisionFixed](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#precisionFixed), [d3.precisionPrefix](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#precisionPrefix) and [d3.precisionRound](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#precisionRound). Theres also a new [d3.formatSpecifier](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#formatSpecifier) method for parsing, validating and debugging format specifiers; its also good for deriving related format specifiers, such as when you want to substitute the precision automatically.

You can now set the default locale using [d3.formatDefaultLocale](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#formatDefaultLocale)! The locales are published as [JSON](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#json) to [npm](https://unpkg.com/d3-format/locale/).

## [Geographies (d3-geo)](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening, various methods have new names:

* d3.geo.graticule  [d3.geoGraticule](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoGraticule)
* d3.geo.circle  [d3.geoCircle](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoCircle)

* d3.geo.projectionMutator  [d3.geoProjectionMutator](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoProjectionMutator)
* d3.geo.albers  [d3.geoAlbers](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoAlbers)
* d3.geo.albersUsa  [d3.geoAlbersUsa](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoAlbersUsa)
* d3.geo.azimuthalEqualArea  [d3.geoAzimuthalEqualArea](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoAzimuthalEqualArea)
* d3.geo.azimuthalEquidistant  [d3.geoAzimuthalEquidistant](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoAzimuthalEquidistant)
* d3.geo.conicConformal  [d3.geoConicConformal](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoConicConformal)
* d3.geo.conicEqualArea  [d3.geoConicEqualArea](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoConicEqualArea)
* d3.geo.conicEquidistant  [d3.geoConicEquidistant](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoConicEquidistant)
* d3.geo.equirectangular  [d3.geoEquirectangular](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoEquirectangular)
* d3.geo.gnomonic  [d3.geoGnomonic](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoGnomonic)
* d3.geo.mercator  [d3.geoMercator](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoMercator)

* d3.geo.stereographic  [d3.geoStereographic](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoStereographic)
* d3.geo.transverseMercator  [d3.geoTransverseMercator](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoTransverseMercator)

Also renamed for consistency:

* *circle*.origin  [*circle*.center](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#circle_center)
* *circle*.angle  [*circle*.radius](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#circle_radius)
* *graticule*.majorExtent  [*graticule*.extentMajor](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#graticule_extentMajor)
* *graticule*.minorExtent  [*graticule*.extentMinor](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#graticule_extentMinor)
* *graticule*.majorStep  [*graticule*.stepMajor](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#graticule_stepMajor)
* *graticule*.minorStep  [*graticule*.stepMinor](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#graticule_stepMinor)

Projections now have more appropriate defaults. For example, [d3.geoOrthographic](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoOrthographic) has a 90 clip angle by default, showing only the front hemisphere, and [d3.geoGnomonic](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoGnomonic) has a default 60 clip angle. The default [projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#path_projection) for [d3.geoPath](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoPath) is now null rather than [d3.geoAlbersUsa](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoAlbersUsa); a null projection is used with [pre-projected geometry](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5557726) and is typically faster to render.

Fallback projectionswhen you pass a function rather than a projection to [*path*.projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#path_projection)are no longer supported. For geographic projections, use [d3.geoProjection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoProjection) or [d3.geoProjectionMutator](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoProjectionMutator) to define a custom projection. For arbitrary geometry transformations, implement the [stream interface](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#streams); see also [d3.geoTransform](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoTransform). The raw projections (e.g., d3.geo.equirectangular.raw) are no longer exported.

## [Hierarchies (d3-hierarchy)](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening:

* d3.layout.cluster  [d3.cluster](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#cluster)
* d3.layout.hierarchy  [d3.hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#hierarchy)
* d3.layout.pack  [d3.pack](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#pack)
* d3.layout.partition  [d3.partition](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#partition)
* d3.layout.tree  [d3.tree](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#tree)
* d3.layout.treemap  [d3.treemap](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap)

As an alternative to using JSON to represent hierarchical data (such as the flare.json format used by many D3 examples), the new [d3.stratify](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#stratify) operator simplifies the conversion of tabular data to hierarchical data! This is convenient if you already have data in a tabular format, such as the result of a SQL query or a CSV file:

```
name,parent
Eve,
Cain,Eve
Seth,Eve
Enos,Seth
Noam,Seth
Abel,Eve
Awan,Eve
Enoch,Awan
Azura,Eve
```

To convert this to a root [*node*](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#hierarchy):

```js
var root = d3.stratify()
    .id(function(d) { return d.name; })
    .parentId(function(d) { return d.parent; })
    (nodes);
```

The resulting *root* can be passed to [d3.tree](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#tree) to produce a tree diagram like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3/master/img/stratify.png" width="298" height="137">

Root nodes can also be created from JSON data using [d3.hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#hierarchy). The hierarchy layouts now take these root nodes as input rather than operating directly on JSON data, which helps to provide a cleaner separation between the input data and the computed layout. (For example, use [*node*.copy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_copy) to isolate layout changes.) It also simplifies the API: rather than each hierarchy layout needing to implement value and sorting accessors, there are now generic [*node*.sum](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_sum) and [*node*.sort](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_sort) methods that work with any hierarchy layout.

The new d3.hierarchy API also provides a richer set of methods for manipulating hierarchical data. For example, to generate an array of all nodes in topological order, use [*node*.descendants](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_descendants); for just leaf nodes, use [*node*.leaves](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_leaves). To highlight the ancestors of a given *node* on mouseover, use [*node*.ancestors](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_ancestors). To generate an array of {source, target} links for a given hierarchy, use [*node*.links](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_links); this replaces *treemap*.links and similar methods on the other layouts. The new [*node*.path](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_path) method replaces d3.layout.bundle; see also [d3.curveBundle](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveBundle) for hierarchical edge bundling.

The hierarchy layouts have been rewritten using new, non-recursive traversal methods ([*node*.each](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_each), [*node*.eachAfter](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_eachAfter) and [*node*.eachBefore](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_eachBefore)), improving performance on large datasets. The d3.tree layout no longer uses a *node*.\_ field to store temporary state during layout.

Treemap tiling is now [extensible](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap-tiling) via [*treemap*.tile](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap_tile)! The default squarified tiling algorithm, [d3.treemapSquarify](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemapSquarify), has been completely rewritten, improving performance and fixing bugs in padding and rounding. The *treemap*.sticky method has been replaced with the [d3.treemapResquarify](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemapResquarify), which is identical to d3.treemapSquarify except it performs stable neighbor-preserving updates. The *treemap*.ratio method has been replaced with [*squarify*.ratio](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#squarify_ratio). And theres a new [d3.treemapBinary](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemapBinary) for binary treemaps!

Treemap padding has also been improved. The treemap now distinguishes between [outer padding](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap_paddingOuter) that separates a parent from its children, and [inner padding](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap_paddingInner) that separates adjacent siblings. You can set the [top-](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap_paddingTop), [right-](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap_paddingRight), [bottom-](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap_paddingBottom) and [left-](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap_paddingLeft)outer padding separately. There are new examples for the traditional [nested treemap](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/911ad09bdead40ec0061) and for L and Fogartys [cascaded treemap](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/f85ffb3a5ac518598043). And theres a new example demonstrating [d3.nest with d3.treemap](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2838bf53e0e65f369f476afd653663a2).

The space-filling layouts [d3.treemap](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#treemap) and [d3.partition](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#partition) now output *x0*, *x1*, *y0*, *y1* on each node instead of *x0*, *dx*, *y0*, *dy*. This improves accuracy by ensuring that the edges of adjacent cells are exactly equal, rather than sometimes being slightly off due to floating point math. The partition layout now supports [rounding](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#partition_round) and [padding](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#partition_padding).

The circle-packing layout, [d3.pack](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#pack), has been completely rewritten to better implement Wang et al.s algorithm, fixing major bugs and improving results! Welzls algorithm is now used to compute the exact [smallest enclosing circle](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/29c534ff0b270054a01c) for each parent, rather than the approximate answer used by Wang et al. The 3.x output is shown on the left; 4.0 is shown on the right:

<img alt="Circle Packing in 3.x" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3/master/img/pack-v3.png" width="420" height="420"> <img alt="Circle Packing in 4.0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3/master/img/pack-v4.png" width="420" height="420">

A non-hierarchical implementation is also available as [d3.packSiblings](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#packSiblings), and the smallest enclosing circle implementation is available as [d3.packEnclose](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#packEnclose). [Pack padding](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#pack_padding) now applies between a parent and its children, as well as between adjacent siblings. In addition, you can now specify padding as a function that is computed dynamically for each parent.

## Internals

The d3.rebind method has been removed. (See the [3.x source](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/v3.5.17/src/core/rebind.js).) If you want to wrap a getter-setter method, the recommend pattern is to implement a wrapper method and check the return value. For example, given a *component* that uses an internal [*dispatch*](#dispatches-d3-dispatch), *component*.on can rebind *dispatch*.on as follows:

```js
component.on = function() {
  var value = dispatch.on.apply(dispatch, arguments);
  return value === dispatch ? component : value;
};
```

The d3.functor method has been removed. (See the [3.x source](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/v3.5.17/src/core/functor.js).) If you want to promote a constant value to a function, the recommended pattern is to implement a closure that returns the constant value. If desired, you can use a helper method as follows:

```js
function constant(x) {
  return function() {
    return x;
  };
}
```

Given a value *x*, to promote *x* to a function if it is not already:

```js
var fx = typeof x === "function" ? x : constant(x);
```

## [Interpolators (d3-interpolate)](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md)

The [d3.interpolate](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolate) method no longer delegates to d3.interpolators, which has been removed; its behavior is now defined by the library. It is now slightly faster in the common case that *b* is a number. It only uses [d3.interpolateRgb](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateRgb) if *b* is a valid CSS color specifier (and not approximately one). And if the end value *b* is null, undefined, true or false, d3.interpolate now returns a constant function which always returns *b*.

The behavior of [d3.interpolateObject](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateObject) and [d3.interpolateArray](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateArray) has changed slightly with respect to properties or elements in the start value *a* that do not exist in the end value *b*: these properties and elements are now ignored, such that the ending value of the interpolator at *t* = 1 is now precisely equal to *b*. So, in 3.x:

```js
d3.interpolateObject({foo: 2, bar: 1}, {foo: 3})(0.5); // {bar: 1, foo: 2.5} in 3.x
```

Whereas in 4.0, *a*.bar is ignored:

```js
d3.interpolateObject({foo: 2, bar: 1}, {foo: 3})(0.5); // {foo: 2.5} in 4.0
```

If *a* or *b* are undefined or not an object, they are now implicitly converted to the empty object or empty array as appropriate, rather than throwing a TypeError.

The d3.interpolateTransform interpolator has been renamed to [d3.interpolateTransformSvg](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateTransformSvg), and there is a new [d3.interpolateTransformCss](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateTransformCss) to interpolate CSS transforms! This allows [d3-transition](#transitions-d3-transition) to automatically interpolate both the SVG [transform attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute) and the CSS [transform style property](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#transform-property). (Note, however, that only 2D CSS transforms are supported.) The d3.transform method has been removed.

Color space interpolators now interpolate opacity (see [d3-color](#colors-d3-color)) and return rgb() or rgba() CSS color specifier strings rather than using the RGB hexadecimal format. This is necessary to support opacity interpolation, but is also beneficial because it matches CSS computed values. When a channel in the start color *a* is undefined, color interpolators now use the corresponding channel value from the end color *b*, or *vice versa*. This logic previously applied to some channels (such as saturation in HSL), but now applies to all channels in all color spaces, and is especially useful when interpolating to or from transparent.

There are now long versions of cylindrical color space interpolators: [d3.interpolateHslLong](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateHslLong), [d3.interpolateHclLong](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateHclLong) and [d3.interpolateCubehelixLong](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateCubehelixLong). These interpolators use linear interpolation of hue, rather than using the shortest path around the 360 hue circle. See [d3.interpolateRainbow](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateRainbow) for an example. The Cubehelix color space is now supported by [d3-color](#colors-d3-color), and so there are now [d3.interpolateCubehelix](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateCubehelix) and [d3.interpolateCubehelixLong](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateCubehelixLong) interpolators.

[Gamma-corrected color interpolation](https://web.archive.org/web/20160112115812/http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma.html) is now supported for both RGB and Cubehelix color spaces as [*interpolate*.gamma](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolate_gamma). For example, to interpolate from purple to orange with a gamma of 2.2 in RGB space:

```js
var interpolate = d3.interpolateRgb.gamma(2.2)("purple", "orange");
```

There are new interpolators for uniform non-rational [B-splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline)! These are useful for smoothly interpolating between an arbitrary sequence of values from *t* = 0 to *t* = 1, such as to generate a smooth color gradient from a discrete set of colors. The [d3.interpolateBasis](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateBasis) and [d3.interpolateBasisClosed](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateBasisClosed) interpolators generate one-dimensional B-splines, while [d3.interpolateRgbBasis](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateRgbBasis) and [d3.interpolateRgbBasisClosed](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateRgbBasisClosed) generate three-dimensional B-splines through RGB color space. These are used by [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic) to generate continuous color scales from ColorBrewers discrete color schemes, such as [PiYG](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/048d21cf747371b11884f75ad896e5a5).

Theres also now a [d3.quantize](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#quantize) method for generating uniformly-spaced discrete samples from a continuous interpolator. This is useful for taking one of the built-in color scales (such as [d3.interpolateViridis](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateViridis)) and quantizing it for use with [d3.scaleQuantize](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleQuantize), [d3.scaleQuantile](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleQuantile) or [d3.scaleThreshold](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleThreshold).

## [Paths (d3-path)](https://github.com/d3/d3-path/blob/master/README.md)

The [d3.path](https://github.com/d3/d3-path/blob/master/README.md#path) serializer implements the [CanvasPathMethods API](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods), allowing you to write code that can render to either Canvas or SVG. For example, given some code that draws to a canvas:

```js
function drawCircle(context, radius) {
  context.moveTo(radius, 0);
  context.arc(0, 0, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
}
```

You can render to SVG as follows:

```js
var context = d3.path();
drawCircle(context, 40);
pathElement.setAttribute("d", context.toString());
```

The path serializer enables [d3-shape](#shapes-d3-shape) to support both Canvas and SVG; see [*line*.context](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#line_context) and [*area*.context](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#area_context), for example.

## [Polygons (d3-polygon)](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/blob/master/README.md)

Theres no longer a d3.geom.polygon constructor; instead you just pass an array of vertices to the polygon methods. So instead of *polygon*.area and *polygon*.centroid, theres [d3.polygonArea](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/blob/master/README.md#polygonArea) and [d3.polygonCentroid](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/blob/master/README.md#polygonCentroid). There are also new [d3.polygonContains](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/blob/master/README.md#polygonContains) and [d3.polygonLength](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/blob/master/README.md#polygonLength) methods. Theres no longer an equivalent to *polygon*.clip, but if [SutherlandHodgman clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SutherlandHodgman_algorithm) is needed, please [file a feature request](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/issues).

The d3.geom.hull operator has been simplified: instead of an operator with *hull*.x and *hull*.y accessors, theres just the [d3.polygonHull](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/blob/master/README.md#polygonHull) method which takes an array of points and returns the convex hull.

## [Quadtrees (d3-quadtree)](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md)

The d3.geom.quadtree method has been replaced by [d3.quadtree](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree). 4.0 removes the concept of quadtree generators (configurable functions that build a quadtree from an array of data); there are now just quadtrees, which you can create via d3.quadtree and add data to via [*quadtree*.add](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_add) and [*quadtree*.addAll](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_addAll). This code in 3.x:

```js
var quadtree = d3.geom.quadtree()
    .extent([[0, 0], [width, height]])
    (data);
```

Can be rewritten in 4.0 as:

```js
var quadtree = d3.quadtree()
    .extent([[0, 0], [width, height]])
    .addAll(data);
```

The new quadtree implementation is vastly improved! It is no longer recursive, avoiding stack overflows when there are large numbers of coincident points. The internal storage is now more efficient, and the implementation is also faster; constructing a quadtree of 1M normally-distributed points takes about one second in 4.0, as compared to three seconds in 3.x.

The change in [internal *node* structure](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#nodes) affects [*quadtree*.visit](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_visit): use *node*.length to distinguish leaf nodes from internal nodes. For example, to iterate over all data in a quadtree:

```js
quadtree.visit(function(node) {
  if (!node.length) {
    do {
      console.log(node.data);
    } while (node = node.next)
  }
});
```

Theres a new [*quadtree*.visitAfter](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_visitAfter) method for visiting nodes in post-order traversal. This feature is used in [d3-force](#forces-d3-force) to implement the [BarnesHut approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarnesHut_simulation).

You can now remove data from a quadtree using [*quadtree*.remove](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_remove) and [*quadtree*.removeAll](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_removeAll). When adding data to a quadtree, the quadtree will now expand its extent by repeated doubling if the new point is outside the existing extent of the quadtree. There are also [*quadtree*.extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_extent) and [*quadtree*.cover](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_cover) methods for explicitly expanding the extent of the quadtree after creation.

Quadtrees support several new utility methods: [*quadtree*.copy](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_copy) returns a copy of the quadtree sharing the same data; [*quadtree*.data](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_data) generates an array of all data in the quadtree; [*quadtree*.size](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_size) returns the number of data points in the quadtree; and [*quadtree*.root](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_root) returns the root node, which is useful for manual traversal of the quadtree. The [*quadtree*.find](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/README.md#quadtree_find) method now takes an optional search radius, which is useful for pointer-based selection in [force-directed graphs](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048).

## [Queues (d3-queue)](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue/blob/master/README.md)

Formerly known as Queue.js and queue-async, [d3.queue](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue) is now included in the default bundle, making it easy to load data files in parallel. It has been rewritten with fewer closures to improve performance, and there are now stricter checks in place to guarantee well-defined behavior. You can now use instanceof d3.queue and inspect the queues internal private state.

## [Random Numbers (d3-random)](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening, the random number generators have new names:

* d3.random.normal  [d3.randomNormal](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomNormal)
* d3.random.logNormal  [d3.randomLogNormal](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomLogNormal)
* d3.random.bates  [d3.randomBates](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomBates)
* d3.random.irwinHall  [d3.randomIrwinHall](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomIrwinHall)

There are also new random number generators for [exponential](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomExponential) and [uniform](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomUniform) distributions. The [normal](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomNormal) and [log-normal](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/README.md#randomLogNormal) random generators have been optimized.

## [Requests (d3-request)](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md)

The d3.xhr method has been renamed to [d3.request](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#request). Basic authentication is now supported using [*request*.user](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#request_user) and [*request*.password](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#request_password). You can now configure a timeout using [*request*.timeout](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#request_timeout).

If an error occurs, the corresponding [ProgressEvent](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-progressevent) of type error is now passed to the error listener, rather than the [XMLHttpRequest](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-xmlhttprequest). Likewise, the ProgressEvent is passed to progress event listeners, rather than using [d3.event](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#event). If [d3.xml](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#xml) encounters an error parsing XML, this error is now reported to error listeners rather than returning a null response.

The [d3.request](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#request), [d3.text](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#text) and [d3.xml](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#xml) methods no longer take an optional mime type as the second argument; use [*request*.mimeType](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#request_mimeType) instead. For example:

```js
d3.xml("file.svg").mimeType("image/svg+xml").get(function(error, svg) {
  
});
```

With the exception of [d3.html](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#html) and [d3.xml](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#xml), Node is now supported via [node-XMLHttpRequest](https://github.com/driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest).

## [Scales (d3-scale)](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening:

* d3.scale.linear  [d3.scaleLinear](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleLinear)
* d3.scale.sqrt  [d3.scaleSqrt](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleSqrt)
* d3.scale.pow  [d3.scalePow](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scalePow)
* d3.scale.log  [d3.scaleLog](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleLog)
* d3.scale.quantize  [d3.scaleQuantize](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleQuantize)
* d3.scale.threshold  [d3.scaleThreshold](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleThreshold)
* d3.scale.quantile  [d3.scaleQuantile](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleQuantile)
* d3.scale.identity  [d3.scaleIdentity](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleIdentity)
* d3.scale.ordinal  [d3.scaleOrdinal](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleOrdinal)
* d3.time.scale  [d3.scaleTime](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleTime)
* d3.time.scale.utc  [d3.scaleUtc](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleUtc)

Scales now generate ticks in the same order as the domain: if you have a descending domain, you now get descending ticks. This change affects the order of tick elements generated by [axes](#axes-d3-axis). For example:

```js
d3.scaleLinear().domain([10, 0]).ticks(5); // [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0]
```

[Log tick formatting](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#log_tickFormat) now assumes a default *count* of ten, not Infinity, if not specified. Log scales with  domains that span many powers (such as from 1e+3 to 1e+29) now return only one [tick](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#log_ticks) per power rather than returning *base* ticks per power. Non-linear quantitative scales are slightly more accurate.

You can now control whether an ordinal scales domain is implicitly extended when the scale is passed a value that is not already in its domain. By default, [*ordinal*.unknown](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#ordinal_unknown) is [d3.scaleImplicit](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleImplicit), causing unknown values to be added to the domain:

```js
var x = d3.scaleOrdinal()
    .domain([0, 1])
    .range(["red", "green", "blue"]);

x.domain(); // [0, 1]
x(2); // "blue"
x.domain(); // [0, 1, 2]
```

By setting *ordinal*.unknown, you instead define the output value for unknown inputs. This is particularly useful for choropleth maps where you want to assign a color to missing data.

```js
var x = d3.scaleOrdinal()
    .domain([0, 1])
    .range(["red", "green", "blue"])
    .unknown(undefined);

x.domain(); // [0, 1]
x(2); // undefined
x.domain(); // [0, 1]
```

The *ordinal*.rangeBands and *ordinal*.rangeRoundBands methods have been replaced with a new subclass of ordinal scale: [band scales](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band-scales). The following code in 3.x:

```js
var x = d3.scale.ordinal()
    .domain(["a", "b", "c"])
    .rangeBands([0, width]);
```

Is equivalent to this in 4.0:

```js
var x = d3.scaleBand()
    .domain(["a", "b", "c"])
    .range([0, width]);
```

The new [*band*.padding](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band_padding), [*band*.paddingInner](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band_paddingInner) and [*band*.paddingOuter](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band_paddingOuter) methods replace the optional arguments to *ordinal*.rangeBands. The new [*band*.bandwidth](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band_bandwidth) and [*band*.step](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band_step) methods replace *ordinal*.rangeBand. Theres also a new [*band*.align](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band_align) method which you can use to control how the extra space outside the bands is distributed, say to shift columns closer to the *y*-axis.

Similarly, the *ordinal*.rangePoints and *ordinal*.rangeRoundPoints methods have been replaced with a new subclass of ordinal scale: [point scales](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#point-scales). The following code in 3.x:

```js
var x = d3.scale.ordinal()
    .domain(["a", "b", "c"])
    .rangePoints([0, width]);
```

Is equivalent to this in 4.0:

```js
var x = d3.scalePoint()
    .domain(["a", "b", "c"])
    .range([0, width]);
```

The new [*point*.padding](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#point_padding) method replaces the optional *padding* argument to *ordinal*.rangePoints. Like *ordinal*.rangeBand with *ordinal*.rangePoints, the [*point*.bandwidth](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#point_bandwidth) method always returns zero; a new [*point*.step](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#point_step) method returns the interval between adjacent points.

The [ordinal scale constructor](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#ordinal-scales) now takes an optional *range* for a shorter alternative to [*ordinal*.range](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#ordinal_range). This is especially useful now that the categorical color scales have been changed to simple arrays of colors rather than specialized ordinal scale constructors:

* d3.scale.category10  [d3.schemeCategory10](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#schemeCategory10)
* d3.scale.category20  [d3.schemeCategory20](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#schemeCategory20)
* d3.scale.category20b  [d3.schemeCategory20b](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#schemeCategory20b)
* d3.scale.category20c  [d3.schemeCategory20c](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#schemeCategory20c)

The following code in 3.x:

```js
var color = d3.scale.category10();
```

Is equivalent to this in 4.0:

```js
var color = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10);
```

[Sequential scales](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleSequential), are a new class of scales with a fixed output [interpolator](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#sequential_interpolator) instead of a [range](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_range). Typically these scales are used to implement continuous sequential or diverging color schemes. Inspired by Matplotlibs new [perceptually-motived colormaps](https://bids.github.io/colormap/), 4.0 now features [viridis](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateViridis), [inferno](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateInferno), [magma](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateMagma), [plasma](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolatePlasma) interpolators for use with sequential scales. Using [d3.quantize](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#quantize), these interpolators can also be applied to [quantile](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#quantile-scales), [quantize](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#quantize-scales) and [threshold](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#threshold-scales) scales.

4.0 also ships new Cubehelix schemes, including [Dave Greens default](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateCubehelixDefault) and a [cyclical rainbow](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#interpolateRainbow) inspired by [Matteo Niccoli](https://mycarta.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/perceptual-rainbow-palette-the-method/):

## [Selections (d3-selection)](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md)

Selections no longer subclass Array using [prototype chain injection](http://perfectionkills.com/how-ecmascript-5-still-does-not-allow-to-subclass-an-array/#wrappers_prototype_chain_injection); they are now plain objects, improving performance. The internal fields (*selection*.\_groups, *selection*.\_parents) are private; please use the documented public API to manipulate selections. The new [*selection*.nodes](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_nodes) method generates an array of all nodes in a selection.

Selections are now immutable: the elements and parents in a selection never change. (The elements attributes and content will of course still be modified!) The [*selection*.sort](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_sort) and [*selection*.data](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_data) methods now return new selections rather than modifying the selection in-place. In addition, [*selection*.append](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_append) no longer merges entering nodes into the update selection; use [*selection*.merge](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_merge) to combine enter and update after a data join. For example, the following [general update pattern](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/a8a5baa4c4a470cda598) in 3.x:

```js
var circle = svg.selectAll("circle").data(data) // UPDATE
    .style("fill", "blue");

circle.exit().remove(); // EXIT

circle.enter().append("circle") // ENTER; modifies UPDATE! 
    .style("fill", "green");

circle // ENTER + UPDATE
    .style("stroke", "black");
```

Would be rewritten in 4.0 as:

```js
var circle = svg.selectAll("circle").data(data) // UPDATE
    .style("fill", "blue");

circle.exit().remove(); // EXIT

circle.enter().append("circle") // ENTER
    .style("fill", "green")
  .merge(circle) // ENTER + UPDATE
    .style("stroke", "black");
```

This change is discussed further in [What Makes Software Good](https://medium.com/@mbostock/what-makes-software-good-943557f8a488).

In 3.x, the [*selection*.enter](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_enter) and [*selection*.exit](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_exit) methods were undefined until you called *selection*.data, resulting in a TypeError if you attempted to access them. In 4.0, now they simply return the empty selection if the selection has not been joined to data.

In 3.x, [*selection*.append](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_append) would always append the new element as the last child of its parent. A little-known trick was to use [*selection*.insert](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_insert) without specifying a *before* selector when entering nodes, causing the entering nodes to be inserted before the following element in the update selection. In 4.0, this is now the default behavior of *selection*.append; if you do not specify a *before* selector to *selection*.insert, the inserted element is appended as the last child. This change makes the general update pattern preserve the relative order of elements and data. For example, given the following DOM:

```html
<div>a</div>
<div>b</div>
<div>f</div>
```

And the following code:

```js
var div = d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
  .data(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"], function(d) { return d || this.textContent; });

div.enter().append("div")
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
```

The resulting DOM will be:

```html
<div>a</div>
<div>b</div>
<div>c</div>
<div>d</div>
<div>e</div>
<div>f</div>
```

Thus, the entering *c*, *d* and *e* are inserted before *f*, since *f* is the following element in the update selection. Although this behavior is sufficient to preserve order if the new datas order is stable, if the data changes order, you must still use [*selection*.order](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_order) to reorder elements.

There is now only one class of selection. 3.x implemented enter selections using a special class with different behavior for *enter*.append and *enter*.select; a consequence of this design was that enter selections in 3.x lacked [certain methods](https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2043). In 4.0, enter selections are simply normal selections; they have the same methods and the same behavior. Placeholder [enter nodes](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/enter.js) now implement [*node*.appendChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild), [*node*.insertBefore](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore), [*node*.querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector), and [*node*.querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelectorAll).

The [*selection*.data](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_data) method has been changed slightly with respect to duplicate keys. In 3.x, if multiple data had the same key, the duplicate data would be ignored and not included in enter, update or exit; in 4.0 the duplicate data is always put in the enter selection. In both 3.x and 4.0, if multiple elements have the same key, the duplicate elements are put in the exit selection. Thus, 4.0s behavior is now symmetric for enter and exit, and the general update pattern will now produce a DOM that matches the data even if there are duplicate keys.

Selections have several new methods! Use [*selection*.raise](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_raise) to move the selected elements to the front of their siblings, so that they are drawn on top; use [*selection*.lower](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_lower) to move them to the back. Use [*selection*.dispatch](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_dispatch) to dispatch a [custom event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) to event listeners.

When called in getter mode, [*selection*.data](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_data) now returns the data for all elements in the selection, rather than just the data for the first group of elements. The [*selection*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_call) method no longer sets the `this` context when invoking the specified function; the *selection* is passed as the first argument to the function, so use that. The [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_on) method now accepts multiple whitespace-separated typenames, so you can add or remove multiple listeners simultaneously. For example:

```js
selection.on("mousedown touchstart", function() {
  console.log(d3.event.type);
});
```

The arguments passed to callback functions has changed slightly in 4.0 to be more consistent. The standard arguments are the elements datum (*d*), the elements index (*i*), and the elements group (*nodes*), with *this* as the element. The slight exception to this convention is *selection*.data, which is evaluated for each group rather than each element; it is passed the groups parent datum (*d*), the group index (*i*), and the selections parents (*parents*), with *this* as the groups parent.

The new [d3.local](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#local-variables) provides a mechanism for defining [local variables](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/e1192fe405703d8321a5187350910e08): state that is bound to DOM elements, and available to any descendant element. This can be a convenient alternative to using [*selection*.each](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_each) or storing local state in data.

The d3.ns.prefix namespace prefix map has been renamed to [d3.namespaces](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#namespaces), and the d3.ns.qualify method has been renamed to [d3.namespace](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#namespace). Several new low-level methods are now available, as well. [d3.matcher](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#matcher) is used internally by [*selection*.filter](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_filter); [d3.selector](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selector) is used by [*selection*.select](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_select); [d3.selectorAll](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selectorAll) is used by [*selection*.selectAll](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_selectAll); [d3.creator](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#creator) is used by [*selection*.append](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_append) and [*selection*.insert](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_insert). The new [d3.window](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#window) returns the owner window for a given element, window or document. The new [d3.customEvent](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#customEvent) temporarily sets [d3.event](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#event) while invoking a function, allowing you to implement controls which dispatch custom events; this is used by [d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag), [d3-zoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom) and [d3-brush](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush).

For the sake of parsimony, the multi-value methodswhere you pass an object to set multiple attributes, styles or properties simultaneouslyhave been extracted to [d3-selection-multi](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi) and are no longer part of the default bundle. The multi-value map methods have also been renamed to plural form to reduce overload: [*selection*.attrs](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi/blob/master/README.md#selection_attrs), [*selection*.styles](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi/blob/master/README.md#selection_styles) and [*selection*.properties](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi/blob/master/README.md#selection_properties).

## [Shapes (d3-shape)](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening:

* d3.svg.line  [d3.line](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#lines)
* d3.svg.line.radial  [d3.radialLine](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#radialLine)
* d3.svg.area  [d3.area](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#areas)

* d3.svg.symbol  [d3.symbol](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbols)
* d3.svg.symbolTypes  [d3.symbolTypes](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolTypes)
* d3.layout.pie  [d3.pie](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#pies)
* d3.layout.stack  [d3.stack](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#stacks)
* d3.svg.diagonal  REMOVED (see [d3/d3-shape#27](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/issues/27))
* d3.svg.diagonal.radial  REMOVED

Shapes are no longer limited to SVG; they can now render to Canvas! Shape generators now support an optional *context*: given a [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D), you can render a shape as a canvas path to be filled or stroked. For example, a [canvas pie chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/8878e7fd82034f1d63cf) might use an arc generator:

```js
var arc = d3.arc()
    .outerRadius(radius - 10)
    .innerRadius(0)
    .context(context);
```

To render an arc for a given datum *d*:

```js
context.beginPath();
arc(d);
context.fill();
```

See [*line*.context](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#line_context), [*area*.context](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#area_context) and [*arc*.context](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#arc_context) for more. Under the hood, shapes use [d3-path](#paths-d3-path) to serialize canvas path methods to SVG path data when the context is null; thus, shapes are optimized for rendering to canvas. You can also now derive lines from areas. The line shares most of the same accessors, such as [*line*.defined](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#line_defined) and [*line*.curve](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#line_curve), with the area from which it is derived. For example, to render the topline of an area, use [*area*.lineY1](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#area_lineY1); for the baseline, use [*area*.lineY0](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#area_lineY0).

4.0 introduces a new curve API for specifying how line and area shapes interpolate between data points. The *line*.interpolate and *area*.interpolate methods have been replaced with [*line*.curve](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#line_curve) and [*area*.curve](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#area_curve). Curves are implemented using the [curve interface](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#custom-curves) rather than as a function that returns an SVG path data string; this allows curves to render to either SVG or Canvas. In addition, *line*.curve and *area*.curve now take a function which instantiates a curve for a given *context*, rather than a string. The full list of equivalents:

* linear  [d3.curveLinear](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveLinear)
* linear-closed  [d3.curveLinearClosed](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveLinearClosed)
* step  [d3.curveStep](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveStep)
* step-before  [d3.curveStepBefore](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveStepBefore)
* step-after  [d3.curveStepAfter](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveStepAfter)
* basis  [d3.curveBasis](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveBasis)
* basis-open  [d3.curveBasisOpen](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveBasisOpen)
* basis-closed  [d3.curveBasisClosed](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveBasisClosed)
* bundle  [d3.curveBundle](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveBundle)
* cardinal  [d3.curveCardinal](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCardinal)
* cardinal-open  [d3.curveCardinalOpen](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCardinalOpen)
* cardinal-closed  [d3.curveCardinalClosed](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCardinalClosed)
* monotone  [d3.curveMonotoneX](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveMonotoneX)

But thats not all! 4.0 now provides parameterized CatmullRom splines as proposed by [Yuksel *et al.*](http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/catmullrom_param/). These are available as [d3.curveCatmullRom](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCatmullRom), [d3.curveCatmullRomClosed](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCatmullRomClosed) and [d3.curveCatmullRomOpen](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCatmullRomOpen).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/catmullRom.png" width="888" height="240" alt="catmullRom">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/catmullRomOpen.png" width="888" height="240" alt="catmullRomOpen">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/catmullRomClosed.png" width="888" height="330" alt="catmullRomClosed">

Each curve type can define its own named parameters, replacing *line*.tension and *area*.tension. For example, CatmullRom splines are parameterized using [*catmullRom*.alpha](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCatmullRom_alpha) and defaults to 0.5, which corresponds to a centripetal spline that avoids self-intersections and overshoot. For a uniform CatmullRom spline instead:

```js
var line = d3.line()
    .curve(d3.curveCatmullRom.alpha(0));
```

4.0 fixes the interpretation of the cardinal spline *tension* parameter, which is now specified as [*cardinal*.tension](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveCardinal_tension) and defaults to zero for a uniform CatmullRom spline; a tension of one produces a linear curve. The first and last segments of basis and cardinal curves have also been fixed! The undocumented *interpolate*.reverse field has been removed. Curves can define different behavior for toplines and baselines by counting the sequence of [*curve*.lineStart](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curve_lineStart) within [*curve*.areaStart](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curve_areaStart). See the [d3.curveStep implementation](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/curve/step.js) for an example.

4.0 fixes numerous bugs in the monotone curve implementation, and introduces [d3.curveMonotoneY](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveMonotoneY); this is like d3.curveMonotoneX, except it requires that the input points are monotone in *y* rather than *x*, such as for a vertically-oriented line chart. The new [d3.curveNatural](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveNatural) produces a [natural cubic spline](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicSpline.html). The default [](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#bundle_beta) for [d3.curveBundle](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#curveBundle) is now 0.85, rather than 0.7, matching the values used by [Holten](https://www.win.tue.nl/vis1/home/dholten/papers/bundles_infovis.pdf). 4.0 also has a more robust implementation of arc padding; see [*arc*.padAngle](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#arc_padAngle) and [*arc*.padRadius](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#arc_padRadius).

4.0 introduces a new symbol type API. Symbol types are passed to [*symbol*.type](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbol_type) in place of strings. The equivalents are:

* circle  [d3.symbolCircle](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolCircle)
* cross  [d3.symbolCross](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolCross)
* diamond  [d3.symbolDiamond](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolDiamond)
* square  [d3.symbolSquare](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolSquare)
* triangle-down  REMOVED
* triangle-up  [d3.symbolTriangle](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolTriangle)
* ADDED  [d3.symbolStar](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolStar)
* ADDED  [d3.symbolWye](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#symbolWye)

The full set of symbol types is now:

<a href="#symbolCircle"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/circle.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolCross"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/cross.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolDiamond"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/diamond.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolSquare"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/square.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolStar"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/star.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolTriangle"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/triangle.png" width="100" height="100"><a href="#symbolWye"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/wye.png" width="100" height="100"></a>

Lastly, 4.0 overhauls the stack layout API, replacing d3.layout.stack with [d3.stack](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#stacks). The stack generator no longer needs an *x*-accessor. In addition, the API has been simplified: the *stack* generator now accepts tabular input, such as this array of objects:

```js
var data = [
  {month: new Date(2015, 0, 1), apples: 3840, bananas: 1920, cherries: 960, dates: 400},
  {month: new Date(2015, 1, 1), apples: 1600, bananas: 1440, cherries: 960, dates: 400},
  {month: new Date(2015, 2, 1), apples:  640, bananas:  960, cherries: 640, dates: 400},
  {month: new Date(2015, 3, 1), apples:  320, bananas:  480, cherries: 640, dates: 400}
];
```

To generate the stack layout, first define a stack generator, and then apply it to the data:

```js
var stack = d3.stack()
    .keys(["apples", "bananas", "cherries", "dates"])
    .order(d3.stackOrderNone)
    .offset(d3.stackOffsetNone);

var series = stack(data);
```

The resulting array has one element per *series*. Each series has one point per month, and each point has a lower and upper value defining the baseline and topline:

```js
[
  [[   0, 3840], [   0, 1600], [   0,  640], [   0,  320]], // apples
  [[3840, 5760], [1600, 3040], [ 640, 1600], [ 320,  800]], // bananas
  [[5760, 6720], [3040, 4000], [1600, 2240], [ 800, 1440]], // cherries
  [[6720, 7120], [4000, 4400], [2240, 2640], [1440, 1840]], // dates
]
```

Each series in then typically passed to an [area generator](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#areas) to render an area chart, or used to construct rectangles for a bar chart. Stack generators no longer modify the input data, so *stack*.out has been removed.

## [Time Formats (d3-time-format)](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening, the format constructors have new names:

* d3.time.format  [d3.timeFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#timeFormat)
* d3.time.format.utc  [d3.utcFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#utcFormat)
* d3.time.format.iso  [d3.isoFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#isoFormat)

The *format*.parse method has also been removed in favor of separate [d3.timeParse](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#timeParse), [d3.utcParse](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#utcParse) and [d3.isoParse](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#isoParse) parser constructors. Thus, this code in 3.x:

```js
var parseTime = d3.time.format("%c").parse;
```

Can be rewritten in 4.0 as:

```js
var parseTime = d3.timeParse("%c");
```

The multi-scale time format d3.time.format.multi has been replaced by [d3.scaleTime](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#scaleTime)s [tick format](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#time_tickFormat). Time formats now coerce inputs to dates, and time parsers coerce inputs to strings. The `%Z` directive now allows more flexible parsing of time zone offsets, such as `-0700`, `-07:00`, `-07`, and `Z`. The `%p` directive is now parsed correctly when the locales period name is longer than two characters (*e.g.*, a.m.).

The default U.S. English locale now uses 12-hour time and a more concise representation of the date. This aligns with local convention and is consistent with [*date*.toLocaleString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString) in Chrome, Firefox and Node:

```js
var now = new Date;
d3.timeFormat("%c")(new Date); // "6/23/2016, 2:01:33 PM"
d3.timeFormat("%x")(new Date); // "6/23/2016"
d3.timeFormat("%X")(new Date); // "2:01:38 PM"
```

You can now set the default locale using [d3.timeFormatDefaultLocale](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/README.md#timeFormatDefaultLocale)! The locales are published as [JSON](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#json) to [npm](https://unpkg.com/d3-time-format/locale/).

The performance of time formatting and parsing has been improved, and the UTC formatter and parser have a cleaner implementation (that avoids temporarily overriding the Date global).

## [Time Intervals (d3-time)](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md)

Pursuant to the great namespace flattening, the local time intervals have been renamed:

* ADDED  [d3.timeMillisecond](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeMillisecond)
* d3.time.second  [d3.timeSecond](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeSecond)

* d3.time.year  [d3.timeYear](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeYear)

The UTC time intervals have likewise been renamed:

* ADDED  [d3.utcMillisecond](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcMillisecond)

* d3.time.sunday.utc  [d3.utcSunday](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcSunday)
* d3.time.monday.utc  [d3.utcMonday](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcMonday)
* d3.time.tuesday.utc  [d3.utcTuesday](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcTuesday)

* d3.time.friday.utc  [d3.utcFriday](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcFriday)
* d3.time.saturday.utc  [d3.utcSaturday](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcSaturday)
* d3.time.week.utc  [d3.utcWeek](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcWeek)
* d3.time.month.utc  [d3.utcMonth](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcMonth)
* d3.time.year.utc  [d3.utcYear](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcYear)

The local time range aliases have been renamed:

* d3.time.seconds  [d3.timeSeconds](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeSeconds)
* d3.time.minutes  [d3.timeMinutes](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeMinutes)

* d3.time.years  [d3.timeYears](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeYears)

The UTC time range aliases have been renamed:

* d3.time.seconds.utc  [d3.utcSeconds](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcSeconds)
* d3.time.minutes.utc  [d3.utcMinutes](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcMinutes)

The behavior of [*interval*.range](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#interval_range) (and the convenience aliases such as [d3.timeDays](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeDays)) has been changed when *step* is greater than one. Rather than filtering the returned dates using the field number, *interval*.range now behaves like [d3.range](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#range): it simply skips, returning every *step*th date. For example, the following code in 3.x returns only odd days of the month:

```js
d3.time.days(new Date(2016, 4, 28), new Date(2016, 5, 5), 2);
// [Sun May 29 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Tue May 31 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Wed Jun 01 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Fri Jun 03 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)]
```

Note the returned array of dates does not start on the *start* date because May 28 is even. Also note that May 31 and June 1 are one day apart, not two! The behavior of d3.timeDays in 4.0 is probably closer to what you expect:

```js
d3.timeDays(new Date(2016, 4, 28), new Date(2016, 5, 5), 2);
// [Sat May 28 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Mon May 30 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Wed Jun 01 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Fri Jun 03 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)]
```

If you want a filtered view of a time interval (say to guarantee that two overlapping ranges are consistent, such as when generating [time scale ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#time_ticks)), you can use the new [*interval*.every](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#interval_every) method or its more general cousin [*interval*.filter](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#interval_filter):

```js
d3.timeDay.every(2).range(new Date(2016, 4, 28), new Date(2016, 5, 5));
// [Sun May 29 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Tue May 31 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Wed Jun 01 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Fri Jun 03 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)]
```

Time intervals now expose an [*interval*.count](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#interval_count) method for counting the number of interval boundaries after a *start* date and before or equal to an *end* date. This replaces d3.time.dayOfYear and related methods in 3.x. For example, this code in 3.x:

```js
var now = new Date;
d3.time.dayOfYear(now); // 165
```

Can be rewritten in 4.0 as:

```js
var now = new Date;
d3.timeDay.count(d3.timeYear(now), now); // 165
```

Likewise, in place of 3.xs d3.time.weekOfYear, in 4.0 you would say:

```js
d3.timeWeek.count(d3.timeYear(now), now); // 24
```

The new *interval*.count is of course more general. For example, you can use it to compute hour-of-week for a heatmap:

```js
d3.timeHour.count(d3.timeWeek(now), now); // 64
```

Here are all the equivalences from 3.x to 4.0:

* d3.time.weekOfYear.utc  [d3.utcWeek](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcWeek).[count](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#interval_count)

D3 4.0 now also lets you define custom time intervals using [d3.timeInterval](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeInterval). The [d3.timeYear](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeYear), [d3.utcYear](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcYear), [d3.timeMillisecond](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#timeMillisecond) and [d3.utcMillisecond](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#utcMillisecond) intervals have optimized implementations of [*interval*.every](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/README.md#interval_every), which is necessary to generate time ticks for very large or very small domains efficiently. More generally, the performance of time intervals has been improved, and time intervals now do a better job with respect to daylight savings in various locales.

## [Timers (d3-timer)](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md)

In D3 3.x, the only way to stop a timer was for its callback to return true. For example, this timer stops after one second:

```js
d3.timer(function(elapsed) {
  console.log(elapsed);
  return elapsed >= 1000;
});
```

In 4.0, use [*timer*.stop](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#timer_stop) instead:

```js
var t = d3.timer(function(elapsed) {
  console.log(elapsed);
  if (elapsed >= 1000) {
    t.stop();
  }
});
```

The primary benefit of *timer*.stop is that timers are not required to self-terminate: they can be stopped externally, allowing for the immediate and synchronous disposal of associated resources, and the separation of concerns. The above is equivalent to:

```js
var t = d3.timer(function(elapsed) {
  console.log(elapsed);
});

d3.timeout(function() {
  t.stop();
}, 1000);
```

This improvement extends to [d3-transition](#transitions-d3-transition): now when a transition is interrupted, its resources are immediately freed rather than having to wait for transition to start.

4.0 also introduces a new [*timer*.restart](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#timer_restart) method for restarting timers, for replacing the callback of a running timer, or for changing its delay or reference time. Unlike *timer*.stop followed by [d3.timer](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#timer), *timer*.restart maintains the invocation priority of an existing timer: it guarantees that the order of invocation of active timers remains the same. The d3.timer.flush method has been renamed to [d3.timerFlush](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#timerFlush).

Some usage patterns in D3 3.x could cause the browser to hang when a background page returned to the foreground. For example, the following code schedules a transition every second:

```js
setInterval(function() {
  d3.selectAll("div").transition().call(someAnimation); // BAD
}, 1000);
```

If such code runs in the background for hours, thousands of queued transitions will try to run simultaneously when the page is foregrounded. D3 4.0 avoids this hang by freezing time in the background: when a page is in the background, time does not advance, and so no queue of timers accumulates to run when the page returns to the foreground. Use d3.timer instead of transitions to schedule a long-running animation, or use [d3.timeout](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#timeout) and [d3.interval](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#interval) in place of setTimeout and setInterval to prevent transitions from being queued in the background:

```js
d3.interval(function() {
  d3.selectAll("div").transition().call(someAnimation); // GOOD
}, 1000);
```

By freezing time in the background, timers are effectively unaware of being backgrounded. Its like nothing happened! 4.0 also now uses high-precision time ([performance.now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)) where available; the current time is available as [d3.now](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#now).

## [Transitions (d3-transition)](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md)

The [*selection*.transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#selection_transition) method now takes an optional *transition* instance which can be used to synchronize a new transition with an existing transition. (This change is discussed further in [What Makes Software Good?](https://medium.com/@mbostock/what-makes-software-good-943557f8a488)) For example:

```js
var t = d3.transition()
    .duration(750)
    .ease(d3.easeLinear);

d3.selectAll(".apple").transition(t)
    .style("fill", "red");

d3.selectAll(".orange").transition(t)
    .style("fill", "orange");
```

Transitions created this way inherit timing from the closest ancestor element, and thus are synchronized even when the referenced *transition* has variable timing such as a staggered delay. This method replaces the deeply magical behavior of *transition*.each in 3.x; in 4.0, [*transition*.each](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_each) is identical to [*selection*.each](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_each). Use the new [*transition*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_on) method to listen to transition events.

The meaning of [*transition*.delay](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_delay) has changed for chained transitions created by [*transition*.transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_transition). The specified delay is now relative to the *previous* transition in the chain, rather than the *first* transition in the chain; this makes it easier to insert interstitial pauses. For example:

```js
d3.selectAll(".apple")
  .transition() // First fade to green.
    .style("fill", "green")
  .transition() // Then red.
    .style("fill", "red")
  .transition() // Wait one second. Then brown, and remove.
    .delay(1000)
    .style("fill", "brown")
    .remove();
```

Time is now frozen in the background; see [d3-timer](#timers-d3-timer) for more information. While it was previously the case that transitions did not run in the background, now they pick up where they left off when the page returns to the foreground. This avoids page hangs by not scheduling an unbounded number of transitions in the background. If you want to schedule an infinitely-repeating transition, use transition events, or use [d3.timeout](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#timeout) and [d3.interval](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#interval) in place of [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout) and [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval).

The [*selection*.interrupt](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#selection_interrupt) method now cancels all scheduled transitions on the selected elements, in addition to interrupting any active transition. When transitions are interrupted, any resources associated with the transition are now released immediately, rather than waiting until the transition starts, improving performance. (See also [*timer*.stop](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/README.md#timer_stop).) The new [d3.interrupt](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#interrupt) method is an alternative to [*selection*.interrupt](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#selection_interrupt) for quickly interrupting a single node.

The new [d3.active](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#active) method allows you to select the currently-active transition on a given *node*, if any. This is useful for modifying in-progress transitions and for scheduling infinitely-repeating transitions. For example, this transition continuously oscillates between red and blue:

```js
d3.select("circle")
  .transition()
    .on("start", function repeat() {
        d3.active(this)
            .style("fill", "red")
          .transition()
            .style("fill", "blue")
          .transition()
            .on("start", repeat);
      });
```

The [life cycle of a transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#the-life-of-a-transition) is now more formally defined and enforced. For example, attempting to change the duration of a running transition now throws an error rather than silently failing. The [*transition*.remove](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_remove) method has been fixed if multiple transition names are in use: the element is only removed if it has no scheduled transitions, regardless of name. The [*transition*.ease](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_ease) method now always takes an [easing function](#easings-d3-ease), not a string. When a transition ends, the tweens are invoked one last time with *t* equal to exactly 1, regardless of the associated easing function.

As with [selections](#selections-d3-selection) in 4.0, all transition callback functions now receive the standard arguments: the elements datum (*d*), the elements index (*i*), and the elements group (*nodes*), with *this* as the element. This notably affects [*transition*.attrTween](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_attrTween) and [*transition*.styleTween](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_styleTween), which no longer pass the *tween* function the current attribute or style value as the third argument. The *transition*.attrTween and *transition*.styleTween methods can now be called in getter modes for debugging or to share tween definitions between transitions.

Homogenous transitions are now optimized! If all elements in a transition share the same tween, interpolator, or event listeners, this state is now shared across the transition rather than separately allocated for each element. 4.0 also uses an optimized default interpolator in place of [d3.interpolate](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolate) for [*transition*.attr](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_attr) and [*transition*.style](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_style). And transitions can now interpolate both [CSS](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateTransformCss) and [SVG](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/README.md#interpolateTransformSvg) transforms.

For reusable components that support transitions, such as [axes](#axes-d3-axis), a new [*transition*.selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_selection) method returns the [selection](#selections-d3-selection) that corresponds to a given transition. There is also a new [*transition*.merge](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_merge) method that is equivalent to [*selection*.merge](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#selection_merge).

For the sake of parsimony, the multi-value map methods have been extracted to [d3-selection-multi](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi) and are no longer part of the default bundle. The multi-value map methods have also been renamed to plural form to reduce overload: [*transition*.attrs](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi/blob/master/README.md#transition_attrs) and [*transition*.styles](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection-multi/blob/master/README.md#transition_styles).

## [Voronoi Diagrams (d3-voronoi)](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md)

The d3.geom.voronoi method has been renamed to [d3.voronoi](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#voronoi), and the *voronoi*.clipExtent method has been renamed to [*voronoi*.extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#voronoi_extent). The undocumented *polygon*.point property in 3.x, which is the element in the input *data* corresponding to the polygon, has been renamed to *polygon*.data.

Calling [*voronoi*](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#_voronoi) now returns the full [Voronoi diagram](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#voronoi-diagrams), which includes topological information: each Voronoi edge exposes *edge*.left and *edge*.right specifying the sites on either side of the edge, and each Voronoi cell is defined as an array of these edges and a corresponding site. The Voronoi diagram can be used to efficiently compute both the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations for a set of points: [*diagram*.polygons](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#diagram_polygons), [*diagram*.links](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#diagram_links), and [*diagram*.triangles](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#diagram_triangles). The new topology is also useful in conjunction with TopoJSON; see the [Voronoi topology example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/cd52a201d7694eb9d890).

The [*voronoi*.polygons](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#voronoi_polygons) and [*diagram*.polygons](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#diagram_polygons) now require an [extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#voronoi_extent); there is no longer an implicit extent of 1e6. The [*voronoi*.links](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#voronoi_links), [*voronoi*.triangles](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#voronoi_triangles), [*diagram*.links](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#diagram_links) and [*diagram*.triangles](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/README.md#diagram_triangles) are now affected by the clip extent: as the Delaunay is computed as the dual of the Voronoi, two sites are only linked if the clipped cells are touching. To compute the Delaunay triangulation without respect to clipping, set the extent to null.

The Voronoi generator finally has well-defined behavior for coincident vertices: the first of a set of coincident points has a defined cell, while the subsequent duplicate points have null cells. The returned array of polygons is sparse, so by using *array*.forEach or *array*.map, you can easily skip undefined cells. The Voronoi generator also now correctly handles the case where no cell edges intersect the extent.

## [Zooming (d3-zoom)](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md)

The zoom behavior d3.behavior.zoom has been renamed to d3.zoom. Zoom behaviors no longer store the active zoom transform (*i.e.*, the visible region; the scale and translate) internally. The zoom transform is now stored on any elements to which the zoom behavior has been applied. The zoom transform is available as *event*.transform within a zoom event or by calling [d3.zoomTransform](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoomTransform) on a given *element*. To zoom programmatically, use [*zoom*.transform](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom_transform) with a given [selection](#selections-d3-selection) or [transition](#transitions-d3-transition); see the [zoom transitions example](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b783fbb2e673561d214e09c7fb5cedee). The *zoom*.event method has been removed.

To make programmatic zooming easier, there are several new convenience methods on top of *zoom*.transform: [*zoom*.translateBy](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom_translateBy), [*zoom*.scaleBy](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom_scaleBy) and [*zoom*.scaleTo](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom_scaleTo). There is also a new API for describing [zoom transforms](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom-transforms). Zoom behaviors are no longer dependent on [scales](#scales-d3-scale), but you can use [*transform*.rescaleX](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#transform_rescaleX), [*transform*.rescaleY](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#transform_rescaleY), [*transform*.invertX](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#transform_invertX) or [*transform*.invertY](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#transform_invertY) to transform a scales domain. 3.xs *event*.scale is replaced with *event*.transform.k, and *event*.translate is replaced with *event*.transform.x and *event*.transform.y. The *zoom*.center method has been removed in favor of programmatic zooming.

The zoom behavior finally supports simple constraints on panning! The new [*zoom*.translateExtent](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom_translateExtent) lets you define the viewable extent of the world: the currently-visible extent (the extent of the viewport, as defined by [*zoom*.extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom_extent)) is always contained within the translate extent. The *zoom*.size method has been replaced by *zoom*.extent, and the default behavior is now smarter: it defaults to the extent of the zoom behaviors owner element, rather than being hardcoded to 960500. (This also improves the default path chosen during smooth zoom transitions!)

The zoom behaviors interaction has also improved. It now correctly handles concurrent wheeling and dragging, as well as concurrent touching and mousing. The zoom behavior now ignores wheel events at the limits of its scale extent, allowing you to scroll past a zoomable area. The *zoomstart* and *zoomend* events have been renamed *start* and *end*. By default, zoom behaviors now ignore right-clicks intended for the context menu; use [*zoom*.filter](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/README.md#zoom_filter) to control which events are ignored. The zoom behavior also ignores emulated mouse events on iOS. The zoom behavior now consumes handled events, making it easier to combine with other interactive behaviors such as [dragging](#dragging-d3-drag).

# D3: Data-Driven Documents

<a href="https://d3js.org"><img src="https://d3js.org/logo.svg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a>

**D3** (or **D3.js**) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.

## Installing

If you use npm, `npm install d3`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/latest). The released bundle supports anonymous AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments. You can load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/d3), or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/d3/). For example:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
```

For the minified version:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
```

You can also use the standalone D3 microlibraries. For example, [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection):

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.js"></script>
```

D3 is written using [ES2015 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html). Create a [custom bundle using Rollup](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/bb09af4c39c79cffcde4), Webpack, or your preferred bundler. To import D3 into an ES2015 application, either import specific symbols from specific D3 modules:

```js
import {scaleLinear} from "d3-scale";
```

Or import everything into a namespace (here, `d3`):

```js
import * as d3 from "d3";
```

In Node:

```js
var d3 = require("d3");
```

You can also require individual modules and combine them into a `d3` object using [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign):

```js
var d3 = Object.assign({}, require("d3-format"), require("d3-geo"), require("d3-geo-projection"));
```

# d3-array

Data in JavaScript is often represented by an array, and so one tends to manipulate arrays when visualizing or analyzing data. Some common forms of manipulation include taking a contiguous slice (subset) of an array, filtering an array using a predicate function, and mapping an array to a parallel set of values using a transform function. Before looking at the set of utilities that this module provides, familiarize yourself with the powerful [array methods built-in to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype).

JavaScript includes **mutation methods** that modify the array:

* [*array*.pop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop) - Remove the last element from the array.
* [*array*.push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) - Add one or more elements to the end of the array.
* [*array*.reverse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse) - Reverse the order of the elements of the array.
* [*array*.shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift) - Remove the first element from the array.
* [*array*.sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) - Sort the elements of the array.
* [*array*.splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) - Add or remove elements from the array.
* [*array*.unshift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift) - Add one or more elements to the front of the array.

There are also **access methods** that return some representation of the array:

* [*array*.concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) - Join the array with other array(s) or value(s).
* [*array*.join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) - Join all elements of the array into a string.
* [*array*.slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) - Extract a section of the array.
* [*array*.indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) - Find the first occurrence of a value within the array.
* [*array*.lastIndexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/lastIndexOf) - Find the last occurrence of a value within the array.

And finally **iteration methods** that apply functions to elements in the array:

* [*array*.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) - Create a new array with only the elements for which a predicate is true.
* [*array*.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) - Call a function for each element in the array.
* [*array*.every](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every) - See if every element in the array satisfies a predicate.
* [*array*.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) - Create a new array with the result of calling a function on every element in the array.
* [*array*.some](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some) - See if at least one element in the array satisfies a predicate.
* [*array*.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) - Apply a function to reduce the array to a single value (from left-to-right).
* [*array*.reduceRight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduceRight) - Apply a function to reduce the array to a single value (from right-to-left).

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-array`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-array.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

### Statistics

Methods for computing basic summary statistics.

<a name="min" href="#min">#</a> d3.<b>min</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/min.js "Source")

Returns the minimum value in the given *array* using natural order. If the array is empty, returns undefined. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the minimum value.

Unlike the built-in [Math.min](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/min), this method ignores undefined, null and NaN values; this is useful for ignoring missing data. In addition, elements are compared using natural order rather than numeric order. For example, the minimum of the strings [20, 3] is 20, while the minimum of the numbers [20, 3] is 3.

See also [scan](#scan) and [extent](#extent).

<a name="max" href="#max">#</a> d3.<b>max</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/max.js "Source")

Returns the maximum value in the given *array* using natural order. If the array is empty, returns undefined. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the maximum value.

Unlike the built-in [Math.max](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max), this method ignores undefined values; this is useful for ignoring missing data. In addition, elements are compared using natural order rather than numeric order. For example, the maximum of the strings [20, 3] is 3, while the maximum of the numbers [20, 3] is 20.

See also [scan](#scan) and [extent](#extent).

<a name="extent" href="#extent">#</a> d3.<b>extent</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/extent.js "Source")

Returns the [minimum](#min) and [maximum](#max) value in the given *array* using natural order. If the array is empty, returns [undefined, undefined]. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the extent.

<a name="sum" href="#sum">#</a> d3.<b>sum</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/sum.js "Source")

Returns the sum of the given *array* of numbers. If the array is empty, returns 0. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the sum. This method ignores undefined and NaN values; this is useful for ignoring missing data.

<a name="mean" href="#mean">#</a> d3.<b>mean</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/mean.js "Source")

Returns the mean of the given *array* of numbers. If the array is empty, returns undefined. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the mean. This method ignores undefined and NaN values; this is useful for ignoring missing data.

<a name="median" href="#median">#</a> d3.<b>median</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/median.js "Source")

Returns the median of the given *array* of numbers using the [R-7 method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_quantiles_from_a_sample). If the array is empty, returns undefined. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the median. This method ignores undefined and NaN values; this is useful for ignoring missing data.

<a name="quantile" href="#quantile">#</a> d3.<b>quantile</b>(<i>array</i>, <i>p</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/quantile.js "Source")

Returns the *p*-quantile of the given **sorted** *array* of numbers, where *p* is a number in the range [0, 1]. For example, the median can be computed using *p* = 0.5, the first quartile at *p* = 0.25, and the third quartile at *p* = 0.75. This particular implementation uses the [R-7 method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Quantiles_of_a_population), which is the default for the R programming language and Excel. For example:

```js
var a = [0, 10, 30];
d3.quantile(a, 0); // 0
d3.quantile(a, 0.5); // 10
d3.quantile(a, 1); // 30
d3.quantile(a, 0.25); // 5
d3.quantile(a, 0.75); // 20
d3.quantile(a, 0.1); // 2
```

An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the quantile.

<a name="variance" href="#variance">#</a> d3.<b>variance</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/variance.js "Source")

Returns an [unbiased estimator of the population variance](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SampleVariance.html) of the given *array* of numbers. If the array has fewer than two values, returns undefined. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the variance. This method ignores undefined and NaN values; this is useful for ignoring missing data.

<a name="deviation" href="#deviation">#</a> d3.<b>deviation</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/deviation.js "Source")

Returns the standard deviation, defined as the square root of the [bias-corrected variance](#variance), of the given *array* of numbers. If the array has fewer than two values, returns undefined. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array*.map(*accessor*) before computing the standard deviation. This method ignores undefined and NaN values; this is useful for ignoring missing data.

### Search

Methods for searching arrays for a specific element.

<a name="scan" href="#scan">#</a> d3.<b>scan</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>comparator</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/scan.js "Source")

Performs a linear scan of the specified *array*, returning the index of the least element according to the specified *comparator*. If the given *array* contains no comparable elements (*i.e.*, the comparator returns NaN when comparing each element to itself), returns undefined. If *comparator* is not specified, it defaults to [ascending](#ascending). For example:

```js
var array = [{foo: 42}, {foo: 91}];
d3.scan(array, function(a, b) { return a.foo - b.foo; }); // 0
d3.scan(array, function(a, b) { return b.foo - a.foo; }); // 1
```

This function is similar to [min](#min), except it allows the use of a comparator rather than an accessor and it returns the index instead of the accessed value. See also [bisect](#bisect).

<a name="bisectLeft" href="#bisectLeft">#</a> d3.<b>bisectLeft</b>(<i>array</i>, <i>x</i>[, <i>lo</i>[, <i>hi</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/bisect.js#L6 "Source")

Returns the insertion point for *x* in *array* to maintain sorted order. The arguments *lo* and *hi* may be used to specify a subset of the array which should be considered; by default the entire array is used. If *x* is already present in *array*, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any existing entries. The return value is suitable for use as the first argument to [splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) assuming that *array* is already sorted. The returned insertion point *i* partitions the *array* into two halves so that all *v* < *x* for *v* in *array*.slice(*lo*, *i*) for the left side and all *v* >= *x* for *v* in *array*.slice(*i*, *hi*) for the right side.

<a name="bisect" href="#bisect">#</a> d3.<b>bisect</b>(<i>array</i>, <i>x</i>[, <i>lo</i>[, <i>hi</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/bisect.js "Source")<br>
<a name="bisectRight" href="#bisectRight">#</a> d3.<b>bisectRight</b>(<i>array</i>, <i>x</i>[, <i>lo</i>[, <i>hi</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/bisect.js#L6 "Source")

Similar to [bisectLeft](#bisectLeft), but returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of *x* in *array*. The returned insertion point *i* partitions the *array* into two halves so that all *v* <= *x* for *v* in *array*.slice(*lo*, *i*) for the left side and all *v* > *x* for *v* in *array*.slice(*i*, *hi*) for the right side.

<a name="bisector" href="#bisector">#</a> d3.<b>bisector</b>(<i>accessor</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/bisector.js "Source")
<br><a name="bisector" href="#bisector">#</a> d3.<b>bisector</b>(<i>comparator</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/bisector.js "Source")

Returns a new bisector using the specified *accessor* or *comparator* function. This method can be used to bisect arrays of objects instead of being limited to simple arrays of primitives. For example, given the following array of objects:

```js
var data = [
  {date: new Date(2011, 1, 1), value: 0.5},
  {date: new Date(2011, 2, 1), value: 0.6},
  {date: new Date(2011, 3, 1), value: 0.7},
  {date: new Date(2011, 4, 1), value: 0.8}
];
```

A suitable bisect function could be constructed as:

```js
var bisectDate = d3.bisector(function(d) { return d.date; }).right;
```

This is equivalent to specifying a comparator:

```js
var bisectDate = d3.bisector(function(d, x) { return d.date - x; }).right;
```

And then applied as *bisectDate*(*array*, *date*), returning an index. Note that the comparator is always passed the search value *x* as the second argument. Use a comparator rather than an accessor if you want values to be sorted in an order different than natural order, such as in descending rather than ascending order.

<a name="bisector_left" href="#bisector_left">#</a> <i>bisector</i>.<b>left</b>(<i>array</i>, <i>x</i>[, <i>lo</i>[, <i>hi</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/bisector.js#L6 "Source")

Equivalent to [bisectLeft](#bisectLeft), but uses this bisectors associated comparator.

<a name="bisector_right" href="#bisector_right">#</a> <i>bisector</i>.<b>right</b>(<i>array</i>, <i>x</i>[, <i>lo</i>[, <i>hi</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/bisector.js#L16 "Source")

Equivalent to [bisectRight](#bisectRight), but uses this bisectors associated comparator.

<a name="ascending" href="#ascending">#</a> d3.<b>ascending</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/ascending.js "Source")

Returns -1 if *a* is less than *b*, or 1 if *a* is greater than *b*, or 0. This is the comparator function for natural order, and can be used in conjunction with the built-in [*array*.sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) method to arrange elements in ascending order. It is implemented as:

```js
function ascending(a, b) {
  return a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : a >= b ? 0 : NaN;
}
```

Note that if no comparator function is specified to the built-in sort method, the default order is lexicographic (alphabetical), not natural! This can lead to surprising behavior when sorting an array of numbers.

<a name="descending" href="#descending">#</a> d3.<b>descending</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/descending.js "Source")

Returns -1 if *a* is greater than *b*, or 1 if *a* is less than *b*, or 0. This is the comparator function for reverse natural order, and can be used in conjunction with the built-in array sort method to arrange elements in descending order.  It is implemented as:

```js
function descending(a, b) {
  return b < a ? -1 : b > a ? 1 : b >= a ? 0 : NaN;
}
```

Note that if no comparator function is specified to the built-in sort method, the default order is lexicographic (alphabetical), not natural! This can lead to surprising behavior when sorting an array of numbers.

### Transformations

Methods for transforming arrays and for generating new arrays.

<a name="cross" href="#cross">#</a> d3.<b>cross</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>[, <i>reducer</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/cross.js "Source")

Returns the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of the two arrays *a* and *b*. For each element *i* in the specified array *a* and each element *j* in the specified array *b*, in order, invokes the specified *reducer* function passing the element *i* and element *j*. If a *reducer* is not specified, it defaults to a function which creates a two-element array for each pair:

```js
function pair(a, b) {
  return [a, b];
}
```

For example:

```js
d3.cross([1, 2], ["x", "y"]); // returns [[1, "x"], [1, "y"], [2, "x"], [2, "y"]]
d3.cross([1, 2], ["x", "y"], (a, b) => a + b); // returns ["1x", "1y", "2x", "2y"]
```

<a name="merge" href="#merge">#</a> d3.<b>merge</b>(<i>arrays</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/merge.js "Source")

Merges the specified *arrays* into a single array. This method is similar to the built-in array concat method; the only difference is that it is more convenient when you have an array of arrays.

```js
d3.merge([[1], [2, 3]]); // returns [1, 2, 3]
```

<a name="pairs" href="#pairs">#</a> d3.<b>pairs</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>reducer</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/pairs.js "Source")

For each adjacent pair of elements in the specified *array*, in order, invokes the specified *reducer* function passing the element *i* and element *i* - 1. If a *reducer* is not specified, it defaults to a function which creates a two-element array for each pair:

```js
function pair(a, b) {
  return [a, b];
}
```

For example:

```js
d3.pairs([1, 2, 3, 4]); // returns [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
d3.pairs([1, 2, 3, 4], (a, b) => b - a); // returns [1, 1, 1];
```

If the specified array has fewer than two elements, returns the empty array.

<a name="permute" href="#permute">#</a> d3.<b>permute</b>(<i>array</i>, <i>indexes</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/permute.js "Source")

Returns a permutation of the specified *array* using the specified array of *indexes*. The returned array contains the corresponding element in array for each index in indexes, in order. For example, permute(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 0])
returns ["b", "c", "a"]. It is acceptable for the array of indexes to be a different length from the array of elements, and for indexes to be duplicated or omitted.

This method can also be used to extract the values from an object into an array with a stable order. Extracting keyed values in order can be useful for generating data arrays in nested selections. For example:

```js
var object = {yield: 27, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "University Farm"},
    fields = ["site", "variety", "yield"];

d3.permute(object, fields); // returns ["University Farm", "Manchuria", 27]
```

<a name="shuffle" href="#shuffle">#</a> d3.<b>shuffle</b>(<i>array</i>[, <i>lo</i>[, <i>hi</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/shuffle.js "Source")

Randomizes the order of the specified *array* using the [FisherYates shuffle](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/).

<a name="ticks" href="#ticks">#</a> d3.<b>ticks</b>(<i>start</i>, <i>stop</i>, <i>count</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/ticks.js "Source")

Returns an array of approximately *count* + 1 uniformly-spaced, nicely-rounded values between *start* and *stop* (inclusive). Each value is a power of ten multiplied by 1, 2 or 5. See also [d3.tickIncrement](#tickIncrement), [d3.tickStep](#tickStep) and [*linear*.ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#linear_ticks).

Ticks are inclusive in the sense that they may include the specified *start* and *stop* values if (and only if) they are exact, nicely-rounded values consistent with the inferred [step](#tickStep). More formally, each returned tick *t* satisfies *start*  *t* and *t*  *stop*.

<a name="tickIncrement" href="#tickIncrement">#</a> d3.<b>tickIncrement</b>(<i>start</i>, <i>stop</i>, <i>count</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/ticks.js#L16 "Source")

Like [d3.tickStep](#tickStep), except requires that *start* is always less than or equal to *step*, and if the tick step for the given *start*, *stop* and *count* would be less than one, returns the negative inverse tick step instead. This method is always guaranteed to return an integer, and is used by [d3.ticks](#ticks) to avoid guarantee that the returned tick values are represented as precisely as possible in IEEE 754 floating point.

<a name="tickStep" href="#tickStep">#</a> d3.<b>tickStep</b>(<i>start</i>, <i>stop</i>, <i>count</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/ticks.js#L16 "Source")

Returns the difference between adjacent tick values if the same arguments were passed to [d3.ticks](#ticks): a nicely-rounded value that is a power of ten multiplied by 1, 2 or 5. Note that due to the limited precision of IEEE 754 floating point, the returned value may not be exact decimals; use [d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) to format numbers for human consumption.

<a name="range" href="#range">#</a> d3.<b>range</b>([<i>start</i>, ]<i>stop</i>[, <i>step</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/range.js "Source")

Returns an array containing an arithmetic progression, similar to the Python built-in [range](http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#range). This method is often used to iterate over a sequence of uniformly-spaced numeric values, such as the indexes of an array or the ticks of a linear scale. (See also [d3.ticks](#ticks) for nicely-rounded values.)

If *step* is omitted, it defaults to 1. If *start* is omitted, it defaults to 0. The *stop* value is exclusive; it is not included in the result. If *step* is positive, the last element is the largest *start* + *i* \* *step* less than *stop*; if *step* is negative, the last element is the smallest *start* + *i* \* *step* greater than *stop*. If the returned array would contain an infinite number of values, an empty range is returned.

The arguments are not required to be integers; however, the results are more predictable if they are. The values in the returned array are defined as *start* + *i* \* *step*, where *i* is an integer from zero to one minus the total number of elements in the returned array. For example:

```js
d3.range(0, 1, 0.2) // [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6000000000000001, 0.8]
```

This unexpected behavior is due to IEEE 754 double-precision floating point, which defines 0.2 * 3 = 0.6000000000000001. Use [d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) to format numbers for human consumption with appropriate rounding; see also [linear.tickFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#linear_tickFormat) in [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale).

Likewise, if the returned array should have a specific length, consider using [array.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) on an integer range. For example:

```js
d3.range(0, 1, 1 / 49); // BAD: returns 50 elements!
d3.range(49).map(function(d) { return d / 49; }); // GOOD: returns 49 elements.
```

<a name="transpose" href="#transpose">#</a> d3.<b>transpose</b>(<i>matrix</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/transpose.js "Source")

Uses the [zip](#zip) operator as a two-dimensional [matrix transpose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose).

<a name="zip" href="#zip">#</a> d3.<b>zip</b>(<i>arrays</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/zip.js "Source")

Returns an array of arrays, where the *i*th array contains the *i*th element from each of the argument *arrays*. The returned array is truncated in length to the shortest array in *arrays*. If *arrays* contains only a single array, the returned array contains one-element arrays. With no arguments, the returned array is empty.

```js
d3.zip([1, 2], [3, 4]); // returns [[1, 3], [2, 4]]
```

### Histograms

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-array/master/img/histogram.png" width="480" height="250" alt="Histogram">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3048450)

Histograms bin many discrete samples into a smaller number of consecutive, non-overlapping intervals. They are often used to visualize the distribution of numerical data.

<a name="histogram" href="#histogram">#</a> d3.<b>histogram</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/histogram.js "Source")

Constructs a new histogram generator with the default settings.

<a name="_histogram" href="#_histogram">#</a> <i>histogram</i>(<i>data</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/histogram.js#L14 "Source")

Computes the histogram for the given array of *data* samples. Returns an array of bins, where each bin is an array containing the associated elements from the input *data*. Thus, the `length` of the bin is the number of elements in that bin. Each bin has two additional attributes:

* `x0` - the lower bound of the bin (inclusive).
* `x1` - the upper bound of the bin (exclusive, except for the last bin).

<a name="histogram_value" href="#histogram_value">#</a> <i>histogram</i>.<b>value</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/histogram.js#L58 "Source")

If *value* is specified, sets the value accessor to the specified function or constant and returns this histogram generator. If *value* is not specified, returns the current value accessor, which defaults to the identity function.

When a histogram is [generated](#_histogram), the value accessor will be invoked for each element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. The default value accessor assumes that the input data are orderable (comparable), such as numbers or dates. If your data are not, then you should specify an accessor that returns the corresponding orderable value for a given datum.

This is similar to mapping your data to values before invoking the histogram generator, but has the benefit that the input data remains associated with the returned bins, thereby making it easier to access other fields of the data.

<a name="histogram_domain" href="#histogram_domain">#</a> <i>histogram</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/histogram.js#L62 "Source")

If *domain* is specified, sets the domain accessor to the specified function or array and returns this histogram generator. If *domain* is not specified, returns the current domain accessor, which defaults to [extent](#extent). The histogram domain is defined as an array [*min*, *max*], where *min* is the minimum observable value and *max* is the maximum observable value; both values are inclusive. Any value outside of this domain will be ignored when the histogram is [generated](#_histogram).

For example, if you are using the the histogram in conjunction with a [linear scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#linear-scales) `x`, you might say:

```js
var histogram = d3.histogram()
    .domain(x.domain())
    .thresholds(x.ticks(20));
```

You can then compute the bins from an array of numbers like so:

```js
var bins = histogram(numbers);
```

Note that the domain accessor is invoked on the materialized array of [values](#histogram_value), not on the input data array.

<a name="histogram_thresholds" href="#histogram_thresholds">#</a> <i>histogram</i>.<b>thresholds</b>([<i>count</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/histogram.js#L66 "Source")
<br><a name="histogram_thresholds" href="#histogram_thresholds">#</a> <i>histogram</i>.<b>thresholds</b>([<i>thresholds</i>])  [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/histogram.js#L66 "Source")

If *thresholds* is specified, sets the [threshold generator](#histogram-thresholds) to the specified function or array and returns this histogram generator. If *thresholds* is not specified, returns the current threshold generator, which by default implements [Sturges formula](#thresholdSturges). (Thus by default, the histogram values must be numbers!) Thresholds are defined as an array of values [*x0*, *x1*, ]. Any value less than *x0* will be placed in the first bin; any value greater than or equal to *x0* but less than *x1* will be placed in the second bin; and so on. Thus, the [generated histogram](#_histogram) will have *thresholds*.length + 1 bins. See [histogram thresholds](#histogram-thresholds) for more information.

Any threshold values outside the [domain](#histogram_domain) are ignored. The first *bin*.x0 is always equal to the minimum domain value, and the last *bin*.x1 is always equal to the maximum domain value.

If a *count* is specified instead of an array of *thresholds*, then the [domain](#histogram_domain) will be uniformly divided into approximately *count* bins; see [ticks](#ticks).

### Histogram Thresholds

These functions are typically not used directly; instead, pass them to [*histogram*.thresholds](#histogram_thresholds). You may also implement your own threshold generator taking three arguments: the array of input [*values*](#histogram_value) derived from the data, and the [observable domain](#histogram_domain) represented as *min* and *max*. The generator may then return either the array of numeric thresholds or the *count* of bins; in the latter case the domain is divided uniformly into approximately *count* bins; see [ticks](#ticks).

<a name="thresholdFreedmanDiaconis" href="#thresholdFreedmanDiaconis">#</a> d3.<b>thresholdFreedmanDiaconis</b>(<i>values</i>, <i>min</i>, <i>max</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/threshold/freedmanDiaconis.js "Source")

Returns the number of bins according to the [FreedmanDiaconis rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Mathematical_definition); the input *values* must be numbers.

<a name="thresholdScott" href="#thresholdScott">#</a> d3.<b>thresholdScott</b>(<i>values</i>, <i>min</i>, <i>max</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/threshold/scott.js "Source")

Returns the number of bins according to [Scotts normal reference rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Mathematical_definition); the input *values* must be numbers.

<a name="thresholdSturges" href="#thresholdSturges">#</a> d3.<b>thresholdSturges</b>(<i>values</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/src/threshold/sturges.js "Source")

Returns the number of bins according to [Sturges formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Mathematical_definition); the input *values* must be numbers.

# d3-axis

The axis component renders human-readable reference marks for [scales](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale). This alleviates one of the more tedious tasks in visualizing data.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-axis`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-axis.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). (To be useful, youll also want to use [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) and [d3-selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection), but these are soft dependencies.) AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-axis.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var axis = d3.axisLeft(scale);

</script>
```

[Try d3-axis in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-axis)

## API Reference

Regardless of orientation, axes are always rendered at the origin. To change the position of the axis with respect to the chart, specify a [transform attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute) on the containing element. For example:

```js
d3.select("body").append("svg")
    .attr("width", 1440)
    .attr("height", 30)
  .append("g")
    .attr("transform", "translate(0,30)")
    .call(axis);
```

The elements created by the axis are considered part of its public API. You can apply external stylesheets or modify the generated axis elements to [customize the axis appearance](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3371592).

[<img alt="Custom Axis" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-axis/master/img/custom.png" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3371592)

An axis consists of a [path element](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathElement) of class domain representing the extent of the scales domain, followed by transformed [g elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups) of class tick representing each of the scales ticks. Each tick has a [line element](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/shapes.html#LineElement) to draw the tick line, and a [text element](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#TextElement) for the tick label. For example, here is a typical bottom-oriented axis:

```html
<g fill="none" font-size="10" font-family="sans-serif" text-anchor="middle">
  <path class="domain" stroke="#000" d="M0.5,6V0.5H880.5V6"></path>
  <g class="tick" opacity="1" transform="translate(0.5,0)">
    <line stroke="#000" y2="6"></line>
    <text fill="#000" y="9" dy="0.71em">0.0</text>
  </g>
  <g class="tick" opacity="1" transform="translate(176.5,0)">
    <line stroke="#000" y2="6"></line>
    <text fill="#000" y="9" dy="0.71em">0.2</text>
  </g>
  <g class="tick" opacity="1" transform="translate(352.5,0)">
    <line stroke="#000" y2="6"></line>
    <text fill="#000" y="9" dy="0.71em">0.4</text>
  </g>
  <g class="tick" opacity="1" transform="translate(528.5,0)">
    <line stroke="#000" y2="6"></line>
    <text fill="#000" y="9" dy="0.71em">0.6</text>
  </g>
  <g class="tick" opacity="1" transform="translate(704.5,0)">
    <line stroke="#000" y2="6"></line>
    <text fill="#000" y="9" dy="0.71em">0.8</text>
  </g>
  <g class="tick" opacity="1" transform="translate(880.5,0)">
    <line stroke="#000" y2="6"></line>
    <text fill="#000" y="9" dy="0.71em">1.0</text>
  </g>
</g>
```

The orientation of an axis is fixed; to change the orientation, remove the old axis and create a new axis.

<a name="axisTop" href="#axisTop">#</a> d3.<b>axisTop</b>(<i>scale</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L159 "Source")

Constructs a new top-oriented axis generator for the given [scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale), with empty [tick arguments](#axis_ticks), a [tick size](#axis_tickSize) of 6 and [padding](#axis_tickPadding) of 3. In this orientation, ticks are drawn above the horizontal domain path.

<a name="axisRight" href="#axisRight">#</a> d3.<b>axisRight</b>(<i>scale</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L163 "Source")

Constructs a new right-oriented axis generator for the given [scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale), with empty [tick arguments](#axis_ticks), a [tick size](#axis_tickSize) of 6 and [padding](#axis_tickPadding) of 3. In this orientation, ticks are drawn to the right of the vertical domain path.

<a name="axisBottom" href="#axisBottom">#</a> d3.<b>axisBottom</b>(<i>scale</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L167 "Source")

Constructs a new bottom-oriented axis generator for the given [scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale), with empty [tick arguments](#axis_ticks), a [tick size](#axis_tickSize) of 6 and [padding](#axis_tickPadding) of 3. In this orientation, ticks are drawn below the horizontal domain path.

<a name="axisLeft" href="#axisLeft">#</a> d3.<b>axisLeft</b>(<i>scale</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L171 "Source")

Constructs a new left-oriented axis generator for the given [scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale), with empty [tick arguments](#axis_ticks), a [tick size](#axis_tickSize) of 6 and [padding](#axis_tickPadding) of 3. In this orientation, ticks are drawn to the left of the vertical domain path.

<a name="_axis" href="#_axis">#</a> <i>axis</i>(<i>context</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L40 "Source")

Render the axis to the given *context*, which may be either a [selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection) of SVG containers (either SVG or G elements) or a corresponding [transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).

<a name="axis_scale" href="#axis_scale">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>scale</b>([<i>scale</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L120 "Source")

If *scale* is specified, sets the [scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) and returns the axis. If *scale* is not specified, returns the current scale.

<a name="axis_ticks" href="#axis_ticks">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>ticks</b>(<i>arguments</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L124 "Source")
<br><a href="#axis_ticks">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>ticks</b>([<i>count</i>[, <i>specifier</i>]])
<br><a href="#axis_ticks">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>ticks</b>([<i>interval</i>[, <i>specifier</i>]])

Sets the *arguments* that will be passed to [*scale*.ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_ticks) and [*scale*.tickFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_tickFormat) when the axis is [rendered](#_axis), and returns the axis generator. The meaning of the *arguments* depends on the [axis scale](#axis_scale) type: most commonly, the arguments are a suggested *count* for the number of ticks (or a [time *interval*](https://github.com/d3/d3-time) for time scales), and an optional [format *specifier*](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) to customize how the tick values are formatted.

This method has no effect if the scale does not implement *scale*.ticks, as with [band](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band-scales) and [point](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#point-scales) scales. To set the tick values explicitly, use [*axis*.tickValues](#axis_tickValues). To set the tick format explicitly, use [*axis*.tickFormat](#axis_tickFormat).

For example, to generate twenty ticks with SI-prefix formatting on a linear scale, say:

```js
axis.ticks(20, "s");
```

To generate ticks every fifteen minutes with a time scale, say:

```js
axis.ticks(d3.timeMinute.every(15));
```

This method is also a convenience function for [*axis*.tickArguments](#axis_tickArguments). For example, this:

```js
axis.ticks(10);
```

Is equivalent to:

```js
axis.tickArguments([10]);
```

<a name="axis_tickArguments" href="#axis_tickArguments">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>tickArguments</b>([<i>arguments</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L128 "Source")

If *arguments* is specified, sets the *arguments* that will be passed to [*scale*.ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_ticks) and [*scale*.tickFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_tickFormat) when the axis is [rendered](#_axis), and returns the axis generator. The meaning of the *arguments* depends on the [axis scale](#axis_scale) type: most commonly, the arguments are a suggested *count* for the number of ticks (or a [time *interval*](https://github.com/d3/d3-time) for time scales), and an optional [format *specifier*](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) to customize how the tick values are formatted.

If *arguments* is specified, this method has no effect if the scale does not implement *scale*.ticks, as with [band](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#band-scales) and [point](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#point-scales) scales. To set the tick values explicitly, use [*axis*.tickValues](#axis_tickValues). To set the tick format explicitly, use [*axis*.tickFormat](#axis_tickFormat).

If *arguments* is not specified, returns the current tick arguments, which defaults to the empty array.

For example, to generate twenty ticks with SI-prefix formatting on a linear scale, say:

```js
axis.tickArguments([20, "s"]);
```

To generate ticks every fifteen minutes with a time scale, say:

```js
axis.tickArguments([d3.timeMinute.every(15)]);
```

See also [*axis*.ticks](#axis_ticks).

<a name="axis_tickValues" href="#axis_tickValues">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>tickValues</b>([<i>values</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L132 "Source")

If a *values* array is specified, the specified values are used for ticks rather than using the scales automatic tick generator. If *values* is null, clears any previously-set explicit tick values and reverts back to the scales tick generator. If *values* is not specified, returns the current tick values, which defaults to null. For example, to generate ticks at specific values:

```js
var xAxis = d3.axisBottom(x)
    .tickValues([1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]);
```

The explicit tick values take precedent over the tick arguments set by [*axis*.tickArguments](#axis_tickArguments). However, any tick arguments will still be passed to the scales [tickFormat](#axis_tickFormat) function if a tick format is not also set.

<a name="axis_tickFormat" href="#axis_tickFormat">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>tickFormat</b>([<i>format</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L136 "Source")

If *format* is specified, sets the tick format function and returns the axis. If *format* is not specified, returns the current format function, which defaults to null. A null format indicates that the scales default formatter should be used, which is generated by calling [*scale*.tickFormat](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#continuous_tickFormat). In this case, the arguments specified by [*axis*.tickArguments](#axis_tickArguments) are likewise passed to *scale*.tickFormat.

See [d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) and [d3-time-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format) for help creating formatters. For example, to display integers with comma-grouping for thousands:

```js
axis.tickFormat(d3.format(",.0f"));
```

More commonly, a format specifier is passed to [*axis*.ticks](#axis_ticks):

```js
axis.ticks(10, ",f");
```

This has the advantage of setting the format precision automatically based on the tick interval.

<a name="axis_tickSize" href="#axis_tickSize">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>tickSize</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L140 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets the [inner](#axis_tickSizeInner) and [outer](#axis_tickSizeOuter) tick size to the specified value and returns the axis. If *size* is not specified, returns the current inner tick size, which defaults to 6.

<a name="axis_tickSizeInner" href="#axis_tickSizeInner">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>tickSizeInner</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L144 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets the inner tick size to the specified value and returns the axis. If *size* is not specified, returns the current inner tick size, which defaults to 6. The inner tick size controls the length of the tick lines, offset from the native position of the axis.

<a name="axis_tickSizeOuter" href="#axis_tickSizeOuter">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>tickSizeOuter</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L148 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets the outer tick size to the specified value and returns the axis. If *size* is not specified, returns the current outer tick size, which defaults to 6. The outer tick size controls the length of the square ends of the domain path, offset from the native position of the axis. Thus, the outer ticks are not actually ticks but part of the domain path, and their position is determined by the associated scales domain extent. Thus, outer ticks may overlap with the first or last inner tick. An outer tick size of 0 suppresses the square ends of the domain path, instead producing a straight line.

<a name="axis_tickPadding" href="#axis_tickPadding">#</a> <i>axis</i>.<b>tickPadding</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis/blob/master/src/axis.js#L152 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the padding to the specified value in pixels and returns the axis. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current padding which defaults to 3 pixels.

# d3-brush

Brushing is the interactive specification a one- or two-dimensional selected region using a pointing gesture, such as by clicking and dragging the mouse. Brushing is often used to select discrete elements, such as dots in a scatterplot or files on a desktop. It can also be used to zoom-in to a region of interest, or to select continuous regions for [cross-filtering data](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) or live histograms:

[<img alt="Mona Lisa Histogram" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-brush/master/img/mona-lisa.jpg" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/0d20834e3d5a46138752f86b9b79727e)

The d3-brush module implements brushing for mouse and touch events using [SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/). Click and drag on the brush selection to translate the selection. Click and drag on one of the selection handles to move the corresponding edge (or edges) of the selection. Click and drag on the invisible overlay to define a new brush selection, or click anywhere within the brushable region while holding down the META () key. Holding down the ALT () key while moving the brush causes it to reposition around its center, while holding down SPACE locks the current brush size, allowing only translation.

Brushes also support programmatic control. For example, you can listen to [*end* events](#brush-events), and then initiate a transition with [*brush*.move](#brush_move) to snap the brush selection to semantic boundaries:

Applies the brush to the specified *group*, which must be a [selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection) of SVG [G elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups). This function is typically not invoked directly, and is instead invoked via [*selection*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_call). For example, to render a brush:

```js
svg.append("g")
    .attr("class", "brush")
    .call(d3.brush().on("brush", brushed));
```

Internally, the brush uses [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) to bind the necessary event listeners for dragging. The listeners use the name `.brush`, so you can subsequently unbind the brush event listeners as follows:

```js
group.on(".brush", null);
```

The brush also creates the SVG elements necessary to display the brush selection and to receive input events for interaction. You can add, remove or modify these elements as desired to change the brush appearance; you can also apply stylesheets to modify the brush appearance. The structure of a two-dimensional brush is as follows:

```html
<g class="brush" fill="none" pointer-events="all" style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
  <rect class="overlay" pointer-events="all" cursor="crosshair" x="0" y="0" width="960" height="500"></rect>
  <rect class="selection" cursor="move" fill="#777" fill-opacity="0.3" stroke="#fff" shape-rendering="crispEdges" x="112" y="194" width="182" height="83"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--n" cursor="ns-resize" x="107" y="189" width="192" height="10"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--e" cursor="ew-resize" x="289" y="189" width="10" height="93"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--s" cursor="ns-resize" x="107" y="272" width="192" height="10"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--w" cursor="ew-resize" x="107" y="189" width="10" height="93"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--nw" cursor="nwse-resize" x="107" y="189" width="10" height="10"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--ne" cursor="nesw-resize" x="289" y="189" width="10" height="10"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--se" cursor="nwse-resize" x="289" y="272" width="10" height="10"></rect>
  <rect class="handle handle--sw" cursor="nesw-resize" x="107" y="272" width="10" height="10"></rect>
</g>
```

The overlay rect covers the brushable area defined by [*brush*.extent](#brush_extent). The selection rect covers the area defined by the current [brush selection](#brushSelection). The handle rects cover the edges and corners of the brush selection, allowing the corresponding value in the brush selection to be modified interactively. To modify the brush selection programmatically, use [*brush*.move](#brush_move).

<a href="#brush_move" name="brush_move">#</a> <i>brush</i>.<b>move</b>(<i>group</i>, <i>selection</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/src/brush.js#L189 "Source")

Sets the active *selection* of the brush on the specified *group*, which must be a [selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection) or a [transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition) of SVG [G elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups). The *selection* must be defined as an array of numbers, or null to clear the brush selection. For a [two-dimensional brush](#brush), it must be defined as [[*x0*, *y0*], [*x1*, *y1*]], where *x0* is the minimum *x*-value, *y0* is the minimum *y*-value, *x1* is the maximum *x*-value, and *y1* is the maximum *y*-value. For an [*x*-brush](#brushX), it must be defined as [*x0*, *x1*]; for a [*y*-brush](#brushY), it must be defined as [*y0*, *y1*]. The selection may also be specified as a function which returns such an array; if a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The returned array defines the brush selection for that element.

<a href="#brush_extent" name="brush_extent">#</a> <i>brush</i>.<b>extent</b>([<i>extent</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/src/brush.js#L521 "Source")

If *extent* is specified, sets the brushable extent to the specified array of points [[*x0*, *y0*], [*x1*, *y1*]], where [*x0*, *y0*] is the top-left corner and [*x1*, *y1*] is the bottom-right corner, and returns this brush. The *extent* may also be specified as a function which returns such an array; if a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. If *extent* is not specified, returns the current extent accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function extent() {
  var svg = this.ownerSVGElement || this;
  return [[0, 0], [svg.width.baseVal.value, svg.height.baseVal.value]];
}
```

This default implementation requires that the owner SVG element have defined [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElementWidthAttribute) and [height](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElementHeightAttribute) attributes rather than (for example) relying on CSS properties or the viewBox attribute; SVG provides no programmatic method for retrieving the [initial viewport size](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#ViewportSpace). Alternatively, consider using [*element*.getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect). (In Firefox, [*element*.clientWidth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientWidth) and [*element*.clientHeight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientHeight) is zero for SVG elements!)

The brush extent determines the size of the invisible overlay and also constrains the brush selection; the brush selection cannot go outside the brush extent.

<a href="#brush_filter" name="brush_filter">#</a> <i>brush</i>.<b>filter</b>([<i>filter</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/src/brush.js#L525 "Source")

If *filter* is specified, sets the filter to the specified function and returns the brush. If *filter* is not specified, returns the current filter, which defaults to:

```js
function filter() {
  return !event.button;
}
```

If the filter returns falsey, the initiating event is ignored and no brush gesture is started. Thus, the filter determines which input events are ignored. The default filter ignores mousedown events on secondary buttons, since those buttons are typically intended for other purposes, such as the context menu.

<a href="#brush_handleSize" name="brush_handleSize">#</a> <i>brush</i>.<b>handleSize</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/src/brush.js#L529 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets the size of the brush handles to the specified number and returns the brush. If *size* is not specified, returns the current handle size, which defaults to six. This method must be called before [applying the brush](#_brush) to a selection; changing the handle size does not affect brushes that were previously rendered.

<a href="#brush_on" name="brush_on">#</a> <i>brush</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>, [<i>listener</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/src/brush.js#L533 "Source")

If *listener* is specified, sets the event *listener* for the specified *typenames* and returns the brush. If an event listener was already registered for the same type and name, the existing listener is removed before the new listener is added. If *listener* is null, removes the current event listeners for the specified *typenames*, if any. If *listener* is not specified, returns the first currently-assigned listener matching the specified *typenames*, if any. When a specified event is dispatched, each *listener* will be invoked with the same context and arguments as [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) listeners: the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

The *typenames* is a string containing one or more *typename* separated by whitespace. Each *typename* is a *type*, optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a *name*, such as `brush.foo` and `brush.bar`; the name allows multiple listeners to be registered for the same *type*. The *type* must be one of the following:

* `start` - at the start of a brush gesture, such as on mousedown.
* `brush` - when the brush moves, such as on mousemove.
* `end` - at the end of a brush gesture, such as on mouseup.

See [*dispatch*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch#dispatch_on) and [Brush Events](#brush-events) for more.

<a href="#brushSelection" name="brushSelection">#</a> d3.<b>brushSelection</b>(<i>node</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush/blob/master/src/brush.js#L118 "Source")

Returns the current brush selection for the specified *node*. Internally, an elements brush state is stored as *element*.\_\_brush; however, you should use this method rather than accessing it directly. If the given *node* has no selection, returns null. Otherwise, the *selection* is defined as an array of numbers. For a [two-dimensional brush](#brush), it is [[*x0*, *y0*], [*x1*, *y1*]], where *x0* is the minimum *x*-value, *y0* is the minimum *y*-value, *x1* is the maximum *x*-value, and *y1* is the maximum *y*-value. For an [*x*-brush](#brushX), it is [*x0*, *x1*]; for a [*y*-brush](#brushY), it is [*y0*, *y1*].

### Brush Events

When a [brush event listener](#brush_on) is invoked, [d3.event](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#event) is set to the current brush event. The *event* object exposes several fields:

* `target` - the associated [brush behavior](#brush).
* `type` - the string start, brush or end; see [*brush*.on](#brush_on).
* `selection` - the current [brush selection](#brushSelection).
* `sourceEvent` - the underlying input event, such as mousemove or touchmove.

</script>
```

[Try d3-chord in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-chord)

## API Reference

<a href="#chord" name="chord">#</a> d3.<b>chord</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/chord.js "Source")

Constructs a new chord layout with the default settings.

<a href="#_chord" name="_chord">#</a> <i>chord</i>(<i>matrix</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/chord.js#L19 "Source")

Computes the chord layout for the specified square *matrix* of size *n**n*, where the *matrix* represents the directed flow amongst a network (a complete digraph) of *n* nodes. The given *matrix* must be an array of length *n*, where each element *matrix*[*i*] is an array of *n* numbers, where each *matrix*[*i*][*j*] represents the flow from the *i*th node in the network to the *j*th node. Each number *matrix*[*i*][*j*] must be nonnegative, though it can be zero if there is no flow from node *i* to node *j*. From the [Circos tableviewer example](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/circos/guide/tables/):

```js
var matrix = [
  [11975,  5871, 8916, 2868],
  [ 1951, 10048, 2060, 6171],
  [ 8010, 16145, 8090, 8045],
  [ 1013,   990,  940, 6907]
];
```

The return value of *chord*(*matrix*) is an array of *chords*, where each chord represents the combined bidirectional flow between two nodes *i* and *j* (where *i* may be equal to *j*) and is an object with the following properties:

* `source` - the source subgroup
* `target` - the target subgroup

Each source and target subgroup is also an object with the following properties:

* `startAngle` - the start angle in radians
* `endAngle` - the end angle in radians
* `value` - the flow value *matrix*[*i*][*j*]
* `index` - the node index *i*
* `subindex` - the node index *j*

The chords are typically passed to [d3.ribbon](#ribbon) to display the network relationships. The returned array includes only chord objects for which the value *matrix*[*i*][*j*] or *matrix*[*j*][*i*] is non-zero. Furthermore, the returned array only contains unique chords: a given chord *ij* represents the bidirectional flow from *i* to *j* *and* from *j* to *i*, and does not contain a duplicate chord *ji*; *i* and *j* are chosen such that the chords source always represents the larger of *matrix*[*i*][*j*] and *matrix*[*j*][*i*]. In other words, *chord*.source.index equals *chord*.target.subindex, *chord*.source.subindex equals *chord*.target.index, *chord*.source.value is greater than or equal to *chord*.target.value, and *chord*.source.value is always greater than zero.

The *chords* array also defines a secondary array of length *n*, *chords*.groups, where each group represents the combined outflow for node *i*, corresponding to the elements *matrix*[*i*][0  *n* - 1], and is an object with the following properties:

* `startAngle` - the start angle in radians
* `endAngle` - the end angle in radians
* `value` - the total outgoing flow value for node *i*
* `index` - the node index *i*

The groups are typically passed to [d3.arc](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#arc) to produce a donut chart around the circumference of the chord layout.

<a href="#chord_padAngle" name="#chord_padAngle">#</a> <i>chord</i>.<b>padAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/chord.js#L104 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the pad angle between adjacent groups to the specified number in radians and returns this chord layout. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current pad angle, which defaults to zero.

<a href="#chord_sortGroups" name="#chord_sortGroups">#</a> <i>chord</i>.<b>sortGroups</b>([<i>compare</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/chord.js#L108 "Source")

If *compare* is specified, sets the group comparator to the specified function or null and returns this chord layout. If *compare* is not specified, returns the current group comparator, which defaults to null. If the group comparator is non-null, it is used to sort the groups by their total outflow. See also [d3.ascending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ascending) and [d3.descending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#descending).

<a href="#chord_sortSubgroups" name="#chord_sortSubgroups">#</a> <i>chord</i>.<b>sortSubgroups</b>([<i>compare</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/chord.js#L112 "Source")

If *compare* is specified, sets the subgroup comparator to the specified function or null and returns this chord layout. If *compare* is not specified, returns the current subgroup comparator, which defaults to null. If the subgroup comparator is non-null, it is used to sort the subgroups corresponding to *matrix*[*i*][0  *n* - 1] for a given group *i* by their total outflow. See also [d3.ascending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ascending) and [d3.descending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#descending).

<a href="#chord_sortChords" name="#chord_sortChords">#</a> <i>chord</i>.<b>sortChords</b>([<i>compare</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/chord.js#L116 "Source")

If *compare* is specified, sets the chord comparator to the specified function or null and returns this chord layout. If *compare* is not specified, returns the current chord comparator, which defaults to null. If the chord comparator is non-null, it is used to sort the [chords](#_chord) by their combined flow; this only affects the *z*-order of the chords. See also [d3.ascending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ascending) and [d3.descending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#descending).

<a href="#ribbon" name="ribbon">#</a> d3.<b>ribbon</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js "Source")

Creates a new ribbon generator with the default settings.

<a href="#_ribbon" name="_ribbon">#</a> <i>ribbon</i>(<i>arguments</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js#L34 "Source")

Generates a ribbon for the given *arguments*. The *arguments* are arbitrary; they are simply propagated to the ribbon generators accessor functions along with the `this` object. For example, with the default settings, a [chord object](#_chord) expected:

```js
var ribbon = d3.ribbon();

ribbon({
  source: {startAngle: 0.7524114, endAngle: 1.1212972, radius: 240},
  target: {startAngle: 1.8617078, endAngle: 1.9842927, radius: 240}
}); // "M164.0162810494058,-175.21032946354026A240,240,0,0,1,216.1595644740915,-104.28347273835429Q0,0,229.9158815306728,68.8381247563705A240,240,0,0,1,219.77316791012538,96.43523560788266Q0,0,164.0162810494058,-175.21032946354026Z"
```

Or equivalently if the radius is instead defined as a constant:

```js
var ribbon = d3.ribbon()
    .radius(240);

ribbon({
  source: {startAngle: 0.7524114, endAngle: 1.1212972},
  target: {startAngle: 1.8617078, endAngle: 1.9842927}
}); // "M164.0162810494058,-175.21032946354026A240,240,0,0,1,216.1595644740915,-104.28347273835429Q0,0,229.9158815306728,68.8381247563705A240,240,0,0,1,219.77316791012538,96.43523560788266Q0,0,164.0162810494058,-175.21032946354026Z"
```

If the ribbon generator has a context, then the ribbon is rendered to this context as a sequence of path method calls and this function returns void. Otherwise, a path data string is returned.

<a href="#ribbon_source" name="ribbon_source">#</a> <i>ribbon</i>.<b>source</b>([<i>source</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js#L74 "Source")

If *source* is specified, sets the source accessor to the specified function and returns this ribbon generator. If *source* is not specified, returns the current source accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function source(d) {
  return d.source;
}
```

<a href="#ribbon_target" name="ribbon_target">#</a> <i>ribbon</i>.<b>target</b>([<i>target</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js#L78 "Source")

If *target* is specified, sets the target accessor to the specified function and returns this ribbon generator. If *target* is not specified, returns the current target accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function target(d) {
  return d.target;
}
```

<a href="#ribbon_radius" name="ribbon_radius">#</a> <i>ribbon</i>.<b>radius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js#L62 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the radius accessor to the specified function and returns this ribbon generator. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current radius accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function radius(d) {
  return d.radius;
}
```

<a href="#ribbon_startAngle" name="ribbon_startAngle">#</a> <i>ribbon</i>.<b>startAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js#L66 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the start angle accessor to the specified function and returns this ribbon generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current start angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function startAngle(d) {
  return d.startAngle;
}
```

The *angle* is specified in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise.

<a href="#ribbon_endAngle" name="ribbon_endAngle">#</a> <i>ribbon</i>.<b>endAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js#L70 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the end angle accessor to the specified function and returns this ribbon generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current end angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function endAngle(d) {
  return d.endAngle;
}
```

The *angle* is specified in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise.

<a href="#ribbon_context" name="ribbon_context">#</a> <i>ribbon</i>.<b>context</b>([<i>context</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord/blob/master/src/ribbon.js#L82 "Source")

If *context* is specified, sets the context and returns this ribbon generator. If *context* is not specified, returns the current context, which defaults to null. If the context is not null, then the [generated ribbon](#_ribbon) is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string representing the generated ribbon is returned. See also [d3-path](https://github.com/d3/d3-path).

## API Reference

* [Objects](#objects)
* [Maps](#maps)
* [Sets](#sets)
* [Nests](#nests)

### Objects

A common data type in JavaScript is the *associative array*, or more simply the *object*, which has a set of named properties. The standard mechanism for iterating over the keys (or property names) in an associative array is the [forin loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in). However, note that the iteration order is undefined. D3 provides several methods for converting associative arrays to standard arrays with numeric indexes.

A word of caution: it is tempting to use plain objects as maps, but this causes [unexpected behavior](http://www.devthought.com/2012/01/18/an-object-is-not-a-hash/) when built-in property names are used as keys, such as `object["__proto__"] = 42` and `"hasOwnProperty" in object`. If you cannot guarantee that map keys and set values will be safe, use [maps](#maps) and [sets](#sets) (or their ES6 equivalents) instead of plain objects.

<a name="keys" href="#keys">#</a> d3.<b>keys</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/keys.js "Source")

Returns an array containing the property names of the specified object (an associative array). The order of the returned array is undefined.

<a name="values" href="#values">#</a> d3.<b>values</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/values.js "Source")

Returns an array containing the property values of the specified object (an associative array). The order of the returned array is undefined.

<a name="entries" href="#entries">#</a> d3.<b>entries</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/entries.js "Source")

Returns an array containing the property keys and values of the specified object (an associative array). Each entry is an object with a key and value attribute, such as `{key: "foo", value: 42}`. The order of the returned array is undefined.

```js
d3.entries({foo: 42, bar: true}); // [{key: "foo", value: 42}, {key: "bar", value: true}]
```

### Maps

Like [ES6 Maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), but with a few differences:

* Keys are coerced to strings.
* [map.each](#map_each), not [map.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/forEach). (Also, no *thisArg*.)
* [map.remove](#map_remove), not [map.delete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/delete).
* [map.entries](#map_entries) returns an array of {key, value} objects, not an iterator of [key, value].
* [map.size](#map_size) is a method, not a [property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/size); also, theres [map.empty](#map_empty).

<a name="map" href="#map">#</a> d3.<b>map</b>([<i>object</i>[, <i>key</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js "Source")

Constructs a new map. If *object* is specified, copies all enumerable properties from the specified object into this map. The specified object may also be an array or another map. An optional *key* function may be specified to compute the key for each value in the array. For example:

```js
var map = d3.map([{name: "foo"}, {name: "bar"}], function(d) { return d.name; });
map.get("foo"); // {"name": "foo"}
map.get("bar"); // {"name": "bar"}
map.get("baz"); // undefined
```

<a name="map_has" href="#map_has">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>has</b>(<i>key</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L7 "Source")

Returns true if and only if this map has an entry for the specified *key* string. Note: the value may be `null` or `undefined`.

<a name="map_get" href="#map_get">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>get</b>(<i>key</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L10 "Source")

<a name="map_set" href="#map_set">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>set</b>(<i>key</i>, <i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L13 "Source")

Sets the *value* for the specified *key* string. If the map previously had an entry for the same *key* string, the old entry is replaced with the new value. Returns the map, allowing chaining. For example:

```js
var map = d3.map()
    .set("foo", 1)
    .set("bar", 2)
    .set("baz", 3);

map.get("foo"); // 1
```

<a name="map_remove" href="#map_remove">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>remove</b>(<i>key</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L17 "Source")

If the map has an entry for the specified *key* string, removes the entry and returns true. Otherwise, this method does nothing and returns false.

<a name="map_clear" href="#map_clear">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>clear</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L21 "Source")

Removes all entries from this map.

<a name="map_keys" href="#map_keys">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>keys</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L24 "Source")

Returns an array of string keys for every entry in this map. The order of the returned keys is arbitrary.

<a name="map_entries" href="#map_entries">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>entries</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L34 "Source")

Returns an array of key-value objects for each entry in this map. The order of the returned entries is arbitrary. Each entrys key is a string, but the value has arbitrary type.

<a name="map_each" href="#map_each">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>each</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L48 "Source")

Calls the specified *function* for each entry in this map, passing the entrys value and key as arguments, followed by the map itself. Returns undefined. The iteration order is arbitrary.

<a name="map_empty" href="#map_empty">#</a> <i>map</i>.<b>empty</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/map.js#L44 "Source")

Returns the number of entries in this map.

### Sets

Like [ES6 Sets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set), but with a few differences:

* Values are coerced to strings.
* [set.each](#set_each), not [set.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/forEach). (Also, no *thisArg*.)
* [set.remove](#set_remove), not [set.delete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/delete).
* [set.size](#set_size) is a method, not a [property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set/size); also, theres [set.empty](#set_empty).

<a name="set" href="#set">#</a> d3.<b>set</b>([<i>array</i>[, <i>accessor</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js "Source")

Constructs a new set. If *array* is specified, adds the given *array* of string values to the returned set. The specified array may also be another set. An optional *accessor* function may be specified, which is equivalent to calling *array.map(accessor)* before constructing the set.

<a name="set_has" href="#set_has">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>has</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L9 "Source")

Returns true if and only if this set has an entry for the specified *value* string.

<a name="set_add" href="#set_add">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>add</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L10 "Source")

Adds the specified *value* string to this set. Returns the set, allowing chaining. For example:

```js
var set = d3.set()
    .add("foo")
    .add("bar")
    .add("baz");

set.has("foo"); // true
```

<a name="set_remove" href="#set_remove">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>remove</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L15 "Source")

If the set contains the specified *value* string, removes it and returns true. Otherwise, this method does nothing and returns false.

<a name="set_clear" href="#set_clear">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>clear</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L16 "Source")

Removes all values from this set.

<a name="set_values" href="#set_values">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>values</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L17 "Source")

Returns an array of the string values in this set. The order of the returned values is arbitrary. Can be used as a convenient way of computing the unique values for a set of strings. For example:

```js
d3.set(["foo", "bar", "foo", "baz"]).values(); // "foo", "bar", "baz"
```

<a name="set_each" href="#set_each">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>each</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L20 "Source")

Calls the specified *function* for each value in this set, passing the value as the first two arguments (for symmetry with [*map*.each](#map_each)), followed by the set itself. Returns undefined. The iteration order is arbitrary.

<a name="set_empty" href="#set_empty">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>empty</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L19 "Source")

Returns true if and only if this set has zero values.

<a name="set_size" href="#set_size">#</a> <i>set</i>.<b>size</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/set.js#L18 "Source")

Returns the number of values in this set.

### Nests

Nesting allows elements in an array to be grouped into a hierarchical tree structure; think of it like the GROUP BY operator in SQL, except you can have multiple levels of grouping, and the resulting output is a tree rather than a flat table. The levels in the tree are specified by key functions. The leaf nodes of the tree can be sorted by value, while the internal nodes can be sorted by key. An optional rollup function will collapse the elements in each leaf node using a summary function. The nest operator (the object returned by [nest](#nest)) is reusable, and does not retain any references to the data that is nested.

For example, consider the following tabular data structure of Barley yields, from various sites in Minnesota during 1931-2:

```js
var yields = [
  {yield: 27.00, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "University Farm"},
  {yield: 48.87, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Waseca"},
  {yield: 27.43, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Morris"},
  ...
];
```

To facilitate visualization, it may be useful to nest the elements first by year, and then by variety, as follows:

```js
var entries = d3.nest()
    .key(function(d) { return d.year; })
    .key(function(d) { return d.variety; })
    .entries(yields);
```

This returns a nested array. Each element of the outer array is a key-values pair, listing the values for each distinct key:

```js
[{key: "1931", values: [
   {key: "Manchuria", values: [
     {yield: 27.00, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "University Farm"},
     {yield: 48.87, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Waseca"},
     {yield: 27.43, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Morris"}, ...]},
   {key: "Glabron", values: [
     {yield: 43.07, variety: "Glabron", year: 1931, site: "University Farm"},
     {yield: 55.20, variety: "Glabron", year: 1931, site: "Waseca"}, ...]}, ...]},
 {key: "1932", values: ...}]
```

The nested form allows easy iteration and generation of hierarchical structures in SVG or HTML.

For a longer introduction to nesting, see:

* Phoebe Brights [D3 Nest Tutorial and examples](http://bl.ocks.org/phoebebright/raw/3176159/)
* Shan Carters [Mister Nester](http://bl.ocks.org/shancarter/raw/4748131/)

<a name="nest" href="#nest">#</a> d3.<b>nest</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js "Source")

Creates a new nest operator. The set of keys is initially empty.

<a name="nest_key" href="#nest_key">#</a> <i>nest</i>.<b>key</b>(<i>key</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js#L4 "Source")

Registers a new *key* function. The *key* function will be invoked for each element in the input array and must return a string identifier to assign the element to its group. Most often, the function is a simple accessor, such as the year and variety accessors above. (Keys functions are *not* passed the input array index.) Each time a key is registered, it is pushed onto the end of the internal array of keys, and the nest operator applies an additional level of nesting.

<a name="nest_sortKeys" href="#nest_sortKeys">#</a> <i>nest</i>.<b>sortKeys</b>(<i>comparator</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js#L5 "Source")

Sorts key values for the [current key](#nest_key) using the specified *comparator* function, such as [d3.ascending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ascending) or [d3.descending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#descending). If no comparator is specified for the current key, the order in which keys will be returned is undefined. For example, to sort years in ascending order and varieties in descending order:

```js
var entries = d3.nest()
    .key(function(d) { return d.year; }).sortKeys(d3.ascending)
    .key(function(d) { return d.variety; }).sortKeys(d3.descending)
    .entries(yields);
```

Note that this only affects the result of [*nest*.entries](#nest_entries); the order of keys returned by [*nest*.map](#nest_map) and [*nest*.object](#nest_object) is always undefined, regardless of comparator.

<a name="nest_sortValues" href="#nest_sortValues">#</a> <i>nest</i>.<b>sortValues</b>(<i>comparator</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js#L6 "Source")

Sorts leaf elements using the specified *comparator* function, such as [d3.ascending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ascending) or [d3.descending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#descending). This is roughly equivalent to sorting the input array before applying the nest operator; however it is typically more efficient as the size of each group is smaller. If no value comparator is specified, elements will be returned in the order they appeared in the input array. This applies to [*nest*.map](#nest_map), [*nest*.entries](#nest_entries) and [*nest*.object](#nest_object).

<a name="nest_rollup" href="#nest_rollup">#</a> <i>nest</i>.<b>rollup</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js#L7 "Source")

Specifies a rollup *function* to be applied on each group of leaf elements. The return value of the rollup function will replace the array of leaf values in either the associative array returned by [*nest*.map](#nest_map) or [*nest*.object](#nest_object); for [*nest*.entries](#nest_entries), it replaces the leaf *entry*.values with *entry*.value. If a [leaf comparator](#nest_sortValues) is specified, the leaf elements are sorted prior to invoking the rollup function.

<a name="nest_map" href="#nest_map">#</a> <i>nest</i>.<b>map</b>(<i>array</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js#L50 "Source")

Applies the nest operator to the specified *array*, returning a nested [map](#map). Each entry in the returned map corresponds to a distinct key value returned by the first key function. The entry value depends on the number of registered key functions: if there is an additional key, the value is another map; otherwise, the value is the array of elements filtered from the input *array* that have the given key value. If no keys are defined, returns the input *array*.

<a name="nest_object" href="#nest_object">#</a> <i>nest</i>.<b>object</b>(<i>array</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js#L49 "Source")

Applies the nest operator to the specified *array*, returning a nested object. Each entry in the returned associative array corresponds to a distinct key value returned by the first key function. The entry value depends on the number of registered key functions: if there is an additional key, the value is another associative array; otherwise, the value is the array of elements filtered from the input *array* that have the given key value.

Note: this method is unsafe if any of the keys conflict with built-in JavaScript properties, such as `__proto__`. If you cannot guarantee that the keys will be safe, you should use [nest.map](#nest_map) instead.

<a name="nest_entries" href="#nest_entries">#</a> <i>nest</i>.<b>entries</b>(<i>array</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/blob/master/src/nest.js#L51 "Source")

Applies the nest operator to the specified *array*, returning an array of key-values entries. Conceptually, this is similar to applying [*map*.entries](#map_entries) to the associative array returned by [*nest*.map](#nest_map), but it applies to every level of the hierarchy rather than just the first (outermost) level. Each entry in the returned array corresponds to a distinct key value returned by the first key function. The entry value depends on the number of registered key functions: if there is an additional key, the value is another nested array of entries; otherwise, the value is the array of elements filtered from the input *array* that have the given key value.

# d3-color

Even though your browser understands a lot about colors, it doesnt offer much help in manipulating colors through JavaScript. The d3-color module therefore provides representations for various color spaces, allowing specification, conversion and manipulation. (Also see [d3-interpolate](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate) for color interpolation.)

For example, take the color named steelblue:

```js
var c = d3.color("steelblue"); // {r: 70, g: 130, b: 180, opacity: 1}
```

Lets try converting it to HSL:

```js
var c = d3.hsl("steelblue"); // {h: 207.27, s: 0.44, l: 0.4902, opacity: 1}
```

Now rotate the hue by 90, bump up the saturation, and format as a string for CSS:

```js
c.h += 90;
c.s += 0.2;
c + ""; // rgb(198, 45, 205)
```

To fade the color slightly:

```js
c.opacity = 0.8;
c + ""; // rgba(198, 45, 205, 0.8)
```

In addition to the ubiquitous and machine-friendly [RGB](#rgb) and [HSL](#hsl) color space, d3-color supports two color spaces that are designed for humans:

* Dave Greens [Cubehelix](#cubehelix)
* [Lab (CIELAB)](#lab) and [HCL (CIELCH)](#hcl)

Cubehelix features monotonic lightness, while Lab and HCL are perceptually uniform. Note that HCL is the cylindrical form of Lab, similar to how HSL is the cylindrical form of RGB.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-color`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-color.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-color.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var steelblue = d3.rgb("steelblue");

</script>
```

[Try d3-color in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-color)

## API Reference

<a name="color" href="#color">#</a> d3.<b>color</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js "Source")

Parses the specified [CSS Color Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#colorunits) *specifier* string, returning an [RGB](#rgb) or [HSL](#hsl) color. If the specifier was not valid, null is returned. Some examples:

* `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
* `rgb(10%, 20%, 30%)`
* `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)`
* `rgba(10%, 20%, 30%, 0.4)`
* `hsl(120, 50%, 20%)`
* `hsla(120, 50%, 20%, 0.4)`
* `#ffeeaa`
* `#fea`
* `steelblue`

The list of supported [named colors](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords) is specified by CSS.

Note: this function may also be used with `instanceof` to test if an object is a color instance. The same is true of color subclasses, allowing you to test whether a color is in a particular color space.

<a name="color_opacity" href="#color_opacity">#</a> *color*.<b>opacity</b>

This colors opacity, typically in the range [0, 1].

<a name="color_rgb" href="#color_rgb">#</a> *color*.<b>rgb</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js#L209 "Source")

Returns the [RGB equivalent](#rgb) of this color. For RGB colors, thats `this`.

<a name="color_brighter" href="#color_brighter">#</a> *color*.<b>brighter</b>([<i>k</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js#L221 "Source")

Returns a brighter copy of this color. If *k* is specified, it controls how much brighter the returned color should be. If *k* is not specified, it defaults to 1. The behavior of this method is dependent on the implementing color space.

<a name="color_darker" href="#color_darker">#</a> *color*.<b>darker</b>([<i>k</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js#L225 "Source")

Returns a darker copy of this color. If *k* is specified, it controls how much darker the returned color should be. If *k* is not specified, it defaults to 1. The behavior of this method is dependent on the implementing color space.

<a name="color_displayable" href="#color_displayable">#</a> *color*.<b>displayable</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js#L169 "Source")

Returns true if and only if the color is displayable on standard hardware. For example, this returns false for an RGB color if any channel value is less than zero or greater than 255, or if the opacity is not in the range [0, 1].

<a name="color_toString" href="#color_toString">#</a> *color*.<b>toString</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js#L172 "Source")

Returns a string representing this color according to the [CSS Object Model specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#serialize-a-css-component-value), such as `rgb(247, 234, 186)`. If this color is not displayable, a suitable displayable color is returned instead. For example, RGB channel values greater than 255 are clamped to 255.

<a name="rgb" href="#rgb">#</a> d3.<b>rgb</b>(<i>r</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>b</i>[, <i>opacity</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js#L209 "Source")<br>
<a href="#rgb">#</a> d3.<b>rgb</b>(<i>specifier</i>)<br>
<a href="#rgb">#</a> d3.<b>rgb</b>(<i>color</i>)<br>

Constructs a new [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) color. The channel values are exposed as `r`, `g` and `b` properties on the returned instance. Use the [RGB color picker](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/78d64ca7ef013b4dcf8f) to explore this color space.

If *r*, *g* and *b* are specified, these represent the channel values of the returned color; an *opacity* may also be specified. If a CSS Color Module Level 3 *specifier* string is specified, it is parsed and then converted to the RGB color space. See [color](#color) for examples. If a [*color*](#color) instance is specified, it is converted to the RGB color space using [*color*.rgb](#color_rgb). Note that unlike [*color*.rgb](#color_rgb) this method *always* returns a new instance, even if *color* is already an RGB color.

<a name="hsl" href="#hsl">#</a> d3.<b>hsl</b>(<i>h</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>l</i>[, <i>opacity</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/color.js#L281 "Source")<br>
<a href="#hsl">#</a> d3.<b>hsl</b>(<i>specifier</i>)<br>
<a href="#hsl">#</a> d3.<b>hsl</b>(<i>color</i>)<br>

Constructs a new [HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) color. The channel values are exposed as `h`, `s` and `l` properties on the returned instance. Use the [HSL color picker](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/debaad4fcce9bcee14cf) to explore this color space.

If *h*, *s* and *l* are specified, these represent the channel values of the returned color; an *opacity* may also be specified. If a CSS Color Module Level 3 *specifier* string is specified, it is parsed and then converted to the HSL color space. See [color](#color) for examples. If a [*color*](#color) instance is specified, it is converted to the RGB color space using [*color*.rgb](#color_rgb) and then converted to HSL. (Colors already in the HSL color space skip the conversion to RGB.)

<a name="lab" href="#lab">#</a> d3.<b>lab</b>(<i>l</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>[, <i>opacity</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/lab.js#L30 "Source")<br>
<a href="#lab">#</a> d3.<b>lab</b>(<i>specifier</i>)<br>
<a href="#lab">#</a> d3.<b>lab</b>(<i>color</i>)<br>

Constructs a new [Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space#CIELAB) color. The channel values are exposed as `l`, `a` and `b` properties on the returned instance. Use the [Lab color picker](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9f37cc207c0cb166921b) to explore this color space.

If *l*, *a* and *b* are specified, these represent the channel values of the returned color; an *opacity* may also be specified. If a CSS Color Module Level 3 *specifier* string is specified, it is parsed and then converted to the Lab color space. See [color](#color) for examples. If a [*color*](#color) instance is specified, it is converted to the RGB color space using [*color*.rgb](#color_rgb) and then converted to Lab. (Colors already in the Lab color space skip the conversion to RGB, and colors in the HCL color space are converted directly to Lab.)

<a name="hcl" href="#hcl">#</a> d3.<b>hcl</b>(<i>h</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>l</i>[, <i>opacity</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/lab.js#L87 "Source")<br>
<a href="#hcl">#</a> d3.<b>hcl</b>(<i>specifier</i>)<br>
<a href="#hcl">#</a> d3.<b>hcl</b>(<i>color</i>)<br>

Constructs a new [HCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space#CIELAB) color. The channel values are exposed as `h`, `c` and `l` properties on the returned instance. Use the [HCL color picker](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3e115519a1b495e0bd95) to explore this color space.

If *h*, *c* and *l* are specified, these represent the channel values of the returned color; an *opacity* may also be specified. If a CSS Color Module Level 3 *specifier* string is specified, it is parsed and then converted to the HCL color space. See [color](#color) for examples. If a [*color*](#color) instance is specified, it is converted to the RGB color space using [*color*.rgb](#color_rgb) and then converted to HCL. (Colors already in the HCL color space skip the conversion to RGB, and colors in the Lab color space are converted directly to HCL.)

<a name="cubehelix" href="#cubehelix">#</a> d3.<b>cubehelix</b>(<i>h</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>l</i>[, <i>opacity</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-color/blob/master/src/cubehelix.js#L32 "Source")<br>
<a href="#cubehelix">#</a> d3.<b>cubehelix</b>(<i>specifier</i>)<br>
<a href="#cubehelix">#</a> d3.<b>cubehelix</b>(<i>color</i>)<br>

Constructs a new [Cubehelix](https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~dag/CUBEHELIX/) color. The channel values are exposed as `h`, `s` and `l` properties on the returned instance. Use the [Cubehelix color picker](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ba8d75e45794c27168b5) to explore this color space.

If *h*, *s* and *l* are specified, these represent the channel values of the returned color; an *opacity* may also be specified. If a CSS Color Module Level 3 *specifier* string is specified, it is parsed and then converted to the Cubehelix color space. See [color](#color) for examples. If a [*color*](#color) instance is specified, it is converted to the RGB color space using [*color*.rgb](#color_rgb) and then converted to Cubehelix. (Colors already in the Cubehelix color space skip the conversion to RGB.)

# d3-dispatch

Dispatching is a convenient mechanism for separating concerns with loosely-coupled code: register named callbacks and then call them with arbitrary arguments. A variety of D3 components, such as [d3-request](https://github.com/d3/d3-request), use this mechanism to emit events to listeners. Think of this like Nodes [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html), except every listener has a well-defined name so its easy to remove or replace them.

For example, to create a dispatch for *start* and *end* events:

```js
var dispatch = d3.dispatch("start", "end");
```

You can then register callbacks for these events using [*dispatch*.on](#dispatch_on):

```js
dispatch.on("start", callback1);
dispatch.on("start.foo", callback2);
dispatch.on("end", callback3);
```

Then, you can invoke all the *start* callbacks using [*dispatch*.call](#dispatch_call) or [*dispatch*.apply](#dispatch_apply):

```js
dispatch.call("start");
```

Like *function*.call, you may also specify the `this` context and any arguments:

```js
dispatch.call("start", {about: "I am a context object"}, "I am an argument");
```

Want a more involved example? See how to use [d3-dispatch for coordinated views](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5872848).

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-dispatch`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-dispatch.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-dispatch.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var dispatch = d3.dispatch("start", "end");

</script>

## API Reference

<a name="dispatch" href="#dispatch">#</a> d3.<b>dispatch</b>(<i>types</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/src/dispatch.js "Source")

Creates a new dispatch for the specified event *types*. Each *type* is a string, such as `"start"` or `"end"`.

<a name="dispatch_on" href="#dispatch_on">#</a> *dispatch*.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>[, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/src/dispatch.js#L26 "Source")

Adds, removes or gets the *callback* for the specified *typenames*. If a *callback* function is specified, it is registered for the specified (fully-qualified) *typenames*. If a callback was already registered for the given *typenames*, the existing callback is removed before the new callback is added.

The specified *typenames* is a string, such as `start` or `end.foo`. The type may be optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a name; the optional name allows multiple callbacks to be registered to receive events of the same type, such as `start.foo` and `start.bar`. To specify multiple typenames, separate typenames with spaces, such as `start end` or `start.foo start.bar`.

To remove all callbacks for a given name `foo`, say `dispatch.on(".foo", null)`.

If *callback* is not specified, returns the current callback for the specified *typenames*, if any. If multiple typenames are specified, the first matching callback is returned.

<a name="dispatch_copy" href="#dispatch_copy">#</a> *dispatch*.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/src/dispatch.js#L49 "Source")

Returns a copy of this dispatch object. Changes to this dispatch do not affect the returned copy and <i>vice versa</i>.

<a name="dispatch_call" href="#dispatch_call">#</a> *dispatch*.<b>call</b>(<i>type</i>[, <i>that</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/src/dispatch.js#L54 "Source")

Like [*function*.call](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call), invokes each registered callback for the specified *type*, passing the callback the specified *arguments*, with *that* as the `this` context. See [*dispatch*.apply](#dispatch_apply) for more information.

<a name="dispatch_apply" href="#dispatch_apply">#</a> *dispatch*.<b>apply</b>(<i>type</i>[, <i>that</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch/blob/master/src/dispatch.js#L59 "Source")

Like [*function*.apply](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call), invokes each registered callback for the specified *type*, passing the callback the specified *arguments*, with *that* as the `this` context. For example, if you wanted to dispatch your *custom* callbacks after handling a native *click* event, while preserving the current `this` context and arguments, you could say:

```js
selection.on("click", function() {
  dispatch.apply("custom", this, arguments);
});
```

You can pass whatever arguments you want to callbacks; most commonly, you might create an object that represents an event, or pass the current datum (*d*) and index (*i*). See [function.call](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Call) and [function.apply](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Apply) for further information.

# d3-drag

[Drag-and-drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_and_drop) is a popular and easy-to-learn pointing gesture: move the pointer to an object, press and hold to grab it, drag the object to a new location, and release to drop. D3s [drag behavior](#api-reference) provides a convenient but flexible abstraction for enabling drag-and-drop interaction on [selections](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection). For example, you can use d3-drag to facilitate interaction with a [force-directed graph](https://github.com/d3/d3-force), or a simulation of colliding circles:

[<img alt="Force Dragging III" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-drag/master/img/force-graph.png" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048)[<img alt="Force Dragging II" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-drag/master/img/force-collide.png" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2990a882e007f8384b04827617752738)

You can also use d3-drag to implement custom user interface elements, such as a slider. But the drag behavior isnt just for moving elements around; there are a variety of ways to respond to a drag gesture. For example, you can use it to lasso elements in a scatterplot, or to paint lines on a canvas:

[<img alt="Line Drawing" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-drag/master/img/drawing.png" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/f705fc55e6f26df29354)

The drag behavior can be combined with other behaviors, such as [d3-zoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom) for zooming.

[<img alt="Drag & Zoom II" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-drag/master/img/dots.png" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3127661b6f13f9316be745e77fdfb084)

The drag behavior is agnostic about the DOM, so you can use it with SVG, HTML or even Canvas! And you can extend it with advanced selection techniques, such as a Voronoi overlay or a closest-target search:

[<img alt="Circle Dragging IV" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-drag/master/img/voronoi.png" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ec10387f24c1fad2acac3bc11eb218a5)[<img alt="Circle Dragging II" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-drag/master/img/canvas.png" width="420" height="219">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c206c20294258c18832ff80d8fd395c3)

Best of all, the drag behavior automatically unifies mouse and touch input, and avoids browser idiosyncrasies. When [Pointer Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/) are more widely available, the drag behavior will support those, too.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-drag`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-drag.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

## API Reference

This table describes how the drag behavior interprets native events:

| Event        | Listening Element | Drag Event | Default Prevented? |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| mousedown   | selection         | start      | no                |
| mousemove   | window           | drag       | yes                |
| mouseup     | window           | end        | yes                |
| dragstart   | window            | -          | yes                |
| selectstart | window            | -          | yes                |
| click       | window            | -          | yes                |
| touchstart   | selection         | start      | no                |
| touchmove    | selection         | drag       | yes                |
| touchend     | selection         | end        | no                |
| touchcancel  | selection         | end        | no                |

The propagation of all consumed events is [immediately stopped](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-stopimmediatepropagation). If you want to prevent some events from initiating a drag gesture, use [*drag*.filter](#drag_filter).

 Necessary to capture events outside an iframe; see [#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br> Only applies during an active, mouse-based gesture; see [#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br> Only applies immediately after some mouse-based gestures; see [*drag*.clickDistance](#drag_clickDistance).
<br> Necessary to allow [click emulation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006511-SW7) on touch input; see [#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br> Ignored if within 500ms of a touch gesture ending; assumes [click emulation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006511-SW7).

<a href="#drag" name="drag">#</a> d3.<b>drag</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/drag.js "Source")

Creates a new drag behavior. The returned behavior, [*drag*](#_drag), is both an object and a function, and is typically applied to selected elements via [*selection*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_call).

<a href="#_drag" name="_drag">#</a> <i>drag</i>(<i>selection</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/drag.js#L31 "Source")

Applies this drag behavior to the specified [*selection*](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection). This function is typically not invoked directly, and is instead invoked via [*selection*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_call). For example, to instantiate a drag behavior and apply it to a selection:

```js
d3.selectAll(".node").call(d3.drag().on("start", started));
```

Internally, the drag behavior uses [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) to bind the necessary event listeners for dragging. The listeners use the name `.drag`, so you can subsequently unbind the drag behavior as follows:

```js
selection.on(".drag", null);
```

Applying the drag behavior also sets the [-webkit-tap-highlight-color](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/AdjustingtheTextSize/AdjustingtheTextSize.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006510-SW5) style to transparent, disabling the tap highlight on iOS. If you want a different tap highlight color, remove or re-apply this style after applying the drag behavior.

<a href="#drag_container" name="drag_container">#</a> <i>drag</i>.<b>container</b>([<i>container</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/drag.js#L31 "Source")

If *container* is specified, sets the container accessor to the specified object or function and returns the drag behavior. If *container* is not specified, returns the current container accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function container() {
  return this.parentNode;
}
```

The *container* of a drag gesture determines the coordinate system of subsequent [drag events](#drag-events), affecting *event*.x and *event*.y. The element returned by the container accessor is subsequently passed to [d3.mouse](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#mouse) or [d3.touch](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#touch), as appropriate, to determine the local coordinates of the pointer.

The default container accessor returns the parent node of the element in the originating selection (see [*drag*](#_drag)) that received the initiating input event. This is often appropriate when dragging SVG or HTML elements, since those elements are typically positioned relative to a parent. For dragging graphical elements with a Canvas, however, you may want to redefine the container as the initiating element itself:

```js
function container() {
  return this;
}
```

Alternatively, the container may be specified as the element directly, such as `drag.container(canvas)`.

<a href="#drag_filter" href="drag_filter">#</a> <i>drag</i>.<b>filter</b>([<i>filter</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/drag.js#L126 "Source")

If *filter* is specified, sets the filter to the specified function and returns the drag behavior. If *filter* is not specified, returns the current filter, which defaults to:

```js
function filter() {
  return !d3.event.button;
}
```

If the filter returns falsey, the initiating event is ignored and no drag gestures are started. Thus, the filter determines which input events are ignored; the default filter ignores mousedown events on secondary buttons, since those buttons are typically intended for other purposes, such as the context menu.

<a href="#drag_subject" name="drag_subject">#</a> <i>drag</i>.<b>subject</b>([<i>subject</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/drag.js#L134 "Source")

If *subject* is specified, sets the subject accessor to the specified object or function and returns the drag behavior. If *subject* is not specified, returns the current subject accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function subject(d) {
  return d == null ? {x: d3.event.x, y: d3.event.y} : d;
}
```

The *subject* of a drag gesture represents *the thing being dragged*. It is computed when an initiating input event is received, such as a mousedown or touchstart, immediately before the drag gesture starts. The subject is then exposed as *event*.subject on subsequent [drag events](#drag-events) for this gesture.

The default subject is the [datum](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_datum) of the element in the originating selection (see [*drag*](#_drag)) that received the initiating input event; if this datum is undefined, an object representing the coordinates of the pointer is created. When dragging circle elements in SVG, the default subject is thus the datum of the circle being dragged. With [Canvas](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-canvas-element), the default subject is the canvas elements datum (regardless of where on the canvas you click). In this case, a custom subject accessor would be more appropriate, such as one that picks the closest circle to the mouse within a given search *radius*:

```js
function subject() {
  var n = circles.length,
      i,
      dx,
      dy,
      d2,
      s2 = radius * radius,
      circle,
      subject;

  for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    circle = circles[i];
    dx = d3.event.x - circle.x;
    dy = d3.event.y - circle.y;
    d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy;
    if (d2 < s2) subject = circle, s2 = d2;
  }

  return subject;
}
```

(If necessary, the above can be accelerated using [*quadtree*.find](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree#quadtree_find).)

The returned subject should be an object that exposes `x` and `y` properties, so that the relative position of the subject and the pointer can be preserved during the drag gesture. If the subject is null or undefined, no drag gesture is started for this pointer; however, other starting touches may yet start drag gestures. See also [*drag*.filter](#drag_filter).

The subject of a drag gesture may not be changed after the gesture starts. The subject accessor is invoked with the same context and arguments as [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) listeners: the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. During the evaluation of the subject accessor, [d3.event](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#event) is a beforestart [drag event](#drag-events). Use *event*.sourceEvent to access the initiating input event and *event*.identifier to access the touch identifier. The *event*.x and *event*.y are relative to the [container](#drag_container), and are computed using [d3.mouse](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#mouse) or [d3.touch](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#touch) as appropriate.

<a href="#drag_clickDistance" name="drag_clickDistance">#</a> <i>drag</i>.<b>clickDistance</b>([<i>distance</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/drag.js#L387 "Source")

If *distance* is specified, sets the maximum distance that the mouse can move between mousedown and mouseup that will trigger a subsequent click event. If at any point between mousedown and mouseup the mouse is greater than or equal to *distance* from its position on mousedown, the click event follwing mouseup will be suppressed. If *distance* is not specified, returns the current distance threshold, which defaults to zero. The distance threshold is measured in client coordinates ([*event*.clientX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/clientX) and [*event*.clientY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/clientY)).

<a href="#drag_on" name="drag_on">#</a> <i>drag</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>, [<i>listener</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/drag.js#L138 "Source")

If *listener* is specified, sets the event *listener* for the specified *typenames* and returns the drag behavior. If an event listener was already registered for the same type and name, the existing listener is removed before the new listener is added. If *listener* is null, removes the current event listeners for the specified *typenames*, if any. If *listener* is not specified, returns the first currently-assigned listener matching the specified *typenames*, if any. When a specified event is dispatched, each *listener* will be invoked with the same context and arguments as [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) listeners: the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

The *typenames* is a string containing one or more *typename* separated by whitespace. Each *typename* is a *type*, optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a *name*, such as `drag.foo` and `drag.bar`; the name allows multiple listeners to be registered for the same *type*. The *type* must be one of the following:

* `start` - after a new pointer becomes active (on mousedown or touchstart).
* `drag` - after an active pointer moves (on mousemove or touchmove).
* `end` - after an active pointer becomes inactive (on mouseup, touchend or touchcancel).

See [*dispatch*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch#dispatch_on) for more.

Changes to registered listeners via *drag*.on during a drag gesture *do not affect* the current drag gesture. Instead, you must use [*event*.on](#event_on), which also allows you to register temporary event listeners for the current drag gesture. **Separate events are dispatched for each active pointer** during a drag gesture. For example, if simultaneously dragging multiple subjects with multiple fingers, a start event is dispatched for each finger, even if both fingers start touching simultaneously. See [Drag Events](#drag-events) for more.

<a href="#dragDisable" name="dragDisable">#</a> d3.<b>dragDisable</b>(<i>window</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/nodrag.js#L4 "Source")

Prevents native drag-and-drop and text selection on the specified *window*. As an alternative to preventing the default action of mousedown events (see [#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9)), this method prevents undesirable default actions following mousedown. In supported browsers, this means capturing dragstart and selectstart events, preventing the associated default actions, and immediately stopping their propagation. In browsers that do not support selection events, the user-select CSS property is set to none on the document element. This method is intended to be called on mousedown, followed by [d3.dragEnable](#dragEnable) on mouseup.

<a href="#dragEnable" name="dragEnable">#</a> d3.<b>dragEnable</b>(<i>window</i>[, <i>noclick</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/nodrag.js#L15 "Source")

Allows native drag-and-drop and text selection on the specified *window*; undoes the effect of [d3.dragDisable](#dragDisable). This method is intended to be called on mouseup, preceded by [d3.dragDisable](#dragDisable) on mousedown. If *noclick* is true, this method also temporarily suppresses click events. The suppression of click events expires after a zero-millisecond timeout, such that it only suppress the click event that would immediately follow the current mouseup event, if any.

### Drag Events

When a [drag event listener](#drag_on) is invoked, [d3.event](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#event) is set to the current drag event. The *event* object exposes several fields:

* `target` - the associated [drag behavior](#drag).
* `type` - the string start, drag or end; see [*drag*.on](#drag_on).
* `subject` - the drag subject, defined by [*drag*.subject](#drag_subject).
* `x` - the new *x*-coordinate of the subject; see [*drag*.container](#drag_container).
* `y` - the new *y*-coordinate of the subject; see [*drag*.container](#drag_container).
* `dx` - the change in *x*-coordinate since the previous drag event.
* `dy` - the change in *y*-coordinate since the previous drag event.
* `identifier` - the string mouse, or a numeric [touch identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#widl-Touch-identifier).
* `active` - the number of currently active drag gestures (on start and end, not including this one).
* `sourceEvent` - the underlying input event, such as mousemove or touchmove.

The *event*.active field is useful for detecting the first start event and the last end event in a sequence of concurrent drag gestures: it is zero when the first drag gesture starts, and zero when the last drag gesture ends.

The *event* object also exposes the [*event*.on](#event_on) method.

<a href="#event_on" name="event_on">#</a> <i>event</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>, [<i>listener</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/blob/master/src/event.js "Source")

Equivalent to [*drag*.on](#drag_on), but only applies to the current drag gesture. Before the drag gesture starts, a [copy](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch#dispatch_copy) of the current drag [event listeners](#drag_on) is made. This copy is bound to the current drag gesture and modified by *event*.on. This is useful for temporary listeners that only receive events for the current drag gesture. For example, this start event listener registers temporary drag and end event listeners as closures:

```js
function started() {
  var circle = d3.select(this).classed("dragging", true);

  d3.event.on("drag", dragged).on("end", ended);

  function dragged(d) {
    circle.raise().attr("cx", d.x = d3.event.x).attr("cy", d.y = d3.event.y);
  }

  function ended() {
    circle.classed("dragging", false);
  }
}
```

# d3-dsv

This module provides a parser and formatter for delimiter-separated values, most commonly [comma-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (CSV) or tab-separated values (TSV). These tabular formats are popular with spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel, and are often more space-efficient than JSON. This implementation is based on [RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).

Comma (CSV) and tab (TSV) delimiters are built-in. For example, to parse:

```js
d3.csvParse("foo,bar\n1,2"); // [{foo: "1", bar: "2"}, columns: ["foo", "bar"]]
d3.tsvParse("foo\tbar\n1\t2"); // [{foo: "1", bar: "2"}, columns: ["foo", "bar"]]
```

Or to format:

```js
d3.csvFormat([{foo: "1", bar: "2"}]); // "foo,bar\n1,2"
d3.tsvFormat([{foo: "1", bar: "2"}]); // "foo\tbar\n1\t2"
```

To use a different delimiter, such as | for pipe-separated values, use [d3.dsvFormat](#dsvFormat):

```js
var psv = d3.dsvFormat("|");

console.log(psv.parse("foo|bar\n1|2")); // [{foo: "1", bar: "2"}, columns: ["foo", "bar"]]
```

<a name="dsvFormat" href="#dsvFormat">#</a> d3.<b>dsvFormat</b>(<i>delimiter</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/src/dsv.js#L30)

Constructs a new DSV parser and formatter for the specified *delimiter*. The *delimiter* must be a single character (*i.e.*, a single 16-bit code unit); so, ASCII delimiters are fine, but emoji delimiters are not.

<a name="dsv_parse" href="#dsv_parse">#</a> *dsv*.<b>parse</b>(<i>string</i>[, <i>row</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/src/dsv.js#L34 "Source")

Parses the specified *string*, which must be in the delimiter-separated values format with the appropriate delimiter, returning an array of objects representing the parsed rows.

Unlike [*dsv*.parseRows](#dsv_parseRows), this method requires that the first line of the DSV content contains a delimiter-separated list of column names; these column names become the attributes on the returned objects. For example, consider the following CSV file:

```
Year,Make,Model,Length
1997,Ford,E350,2.34
2000,Mercury,Cougar,2.38
```

The resulting JavaScript array is:

```js
[
  {"Year": "1997", "Make": "Ford", "Model": "E350", "Length": "2.34"},
  {"Year": "2000", "Make": "Mercury", "Model": "Cougar", "Length": "2.38"}
]
```

The returned array also exposes a `columns` property containing the column names in input order (in contrast to Object.keys, whose iteration order is arbitrary). For example:

```js
data.columns; // ["Year", "Make", "Model", "Length"]
```

If a *row* conversion function is not specified, field values are strings. For safety, there is no automatic conversion to numbers, dates, or other types. In some cases, JavaScript may coerce strings to numbers for you automatically (for example, using the `+` operator), but better is to specify a *row* conversion function.

If a *row* conversion function is specified, the specified function is invoked for each row, being passed an object representing the current row (`d`), the index (`i`) starting at zero for the first non-header row, and the array of column names. If the returned value is null or undefined, the row is skipped and will be ommitted from the array returned by *dsv*.parse; otherwise, the returned value defines the corresponding row object. For example:

```js
var data = d3.csvParse(string, function(d) {
  return {
    year: new Date(+d.Year, 0, 1), // lowercase and convert "Year" to Date
    make: d.Make, // lowercase
    model: d.Model, // lowercase
    length: +d.Length // lowercase and convert "Length" to number
  };
});
```

Note: using `+` rather than [parseInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt) or [parseFloat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat) is typically faster, though more restrictive. For example, `"30px"` when coerced using `+` returns `NaN`, while parseInt and parseFloat return `30`.

<a name="dsv_parseRows" href="#dsv_parseRows">#</a> <i>dsv</i>.<b>parseRows</b>(<i>string</i>[, <i>row</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/src/dsv.js#L43 "Source")

Parses the specified *string*, which must be in the delimiter-separated values format with the appropriate delimiter, returning an array of arrays representing the parsed rows.

Unlike [*dsv*.parse](#dsv_parse), this method treats the header line as a standard row, and should be used whenever DSV content does not contain a header. Each row is represented as an array rather than an object. Rows may have variable length. For example, consider the following CSV file, which notably lacks a header line:

```
1997,Ford,E350,2.34
2000,Mercury,Cougar,2.38
```

The resulting JavaScript array is:

```js
[
  ["1997", "Ford", "E350", "2.34"],
  ["2000", "Mercury", "Cougar", "2.38"]
]
```

If a *row* conversion function is not specified, field values are strings. For safety, there is no automatic conversion to numbers, dates, or other types. In some cases, JavaScript may coerce strings to numbers for you automatically (for example, using the `+` operator), but better is to specify a *row* conversion function.

If a *row* conversion function is specified, the specified function is invoked for each row, being passed an array representing the current row (`d`), the index (`i`) starting at zero for the first row, and the array of column names. If the returned value is null or undefined, the row is skipped and will be ommitted from the array returned by *dsv*.parse; otherwise, the returned value defines the corresponding row object. For example:

```js
var data = d3.csvParseRows(string, function(d, i) {
  return {
    year: new Date(+d[0], 0, 1), // convert first colum column to Date
    make: d[1],
    model: d[2],
    length: +d[3] // convert fourth column to number
  };
});
```

In effect, *row* is similar to applying a [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) operator to the returned rows.

<a name="dsv_format" href="#dsv_format">#</a> <i>dsv</i>.<b>format</b>(<i>rows</i>[, <i>columns</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/src/dsv.js#L105 "Source")

Formats the specified array of object *rows* as delimiter-separated values, returning a string. This operation is the inverse of [*dsv*.parse](#dsv_parse). Each row will be separated by a newline (`\n`), and each column within each row will be separated by the delimiter (such as a comma, `,`). Values that contain either the delimiter, a double-quote (`"`) or a newline will be escaped using double-quotes.

If *columns* is not specified, the list of column names that forms the header row is determined by the union of all properties on all objects in *rows*; the order of columns is nondeterministic. If *columns* is specified, it is an array of strings representing the column names. For example:

```js
var string = d3.csvFormat(data, ["year", "make", "model", "length"]);
```

All fields on each row object will be coerced to strings. For more control over which and how fields are formatted, first map *rows* to an array of array of string, and then use [*dsv*.formatRows](#dsv_formatRows).

<a name="dsv_formatRows" href="#dsv_formatRows">#</a> <i>dsv</i>.<b>formatRows</b>(<i>rows</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/src/dsv.js#L114 "Source")

Formats the specified array of array of string *rows* as delimiter-separated values, returning a string. This operation is the reverse of [*dsv*.parseRows](#dsv_parseRows). Each row will be separated by a newline (`\n`), and each column within each row will be separated by the delimiter (such as a comma, `,`). Values that contain either the delimiter, a double-quote (") or a newline will be escaped using double-quotes.

To convert an array of objects to an array of arrays while explicitly specifying the columns, use [*array*.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). For example:

```js
var string = d3.csvFormatRows(data.map(function(d, i) {
  return [
    d.year.getFullYear(), // Assuming d.year is a Date object.
    d.make,
    d.model,
    d.length
  ];
}));
```

If you like, you can also [*array*.concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) this result with an array of column names to generate the first row:

```js
var string = d3.csvFormatRows([[
    "year",
    "make",
    "model",
    "length"
  ]].concat(data.map(function(d, i) {
  return [
    d.year.getFullYear(), // Assuming d.year is a Date object.
    d.make,
    d.model,
    d.length
  ];
})));
```

### Content Security Policy

If a [content security policy](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/) is in place, note that [*dsv*.parse](#dsv_parse) requires `unsafe-eval` in the `script-src` directive, due to the (safe) use of dynamic code generation for fast parsing. (See [source](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv/blob/master/src/dsv.js).) Alternatively, use [*dsv*.parseRows](#dsv_parseRows).

# d3-ease

*Easing* is a method of distorting time to control apparent motion in animation. It is most commonly used for [slow-in, slow-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Slow_In_and_Slow_Out). By easing time, [animated transitions](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition) are smoother and exhibit more plausible motion.

The easing types in this module implement the [ease method](#ease_ease), which takes a normalized time *t* and returns the corresponding eased time *t*. Both the normalized time and the eased time are typically in the range [0,1], where 0 represents the start of the animation and 1 represents the end; some easing types, such as [elastic](#easeElastic), may return eased times slightly outside this range. A good easing type should return 0 if *t* = 0 and 1 if *t* = 1. See the [easing explorer](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/248bac3b8e354a9103c4) for a visual demonstration.

These easing types are largely based on work by [Robert Penner](http://robertpenner.com/easing/).

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-ease`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-ease.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-ease.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var ease = d3.easeCubic;

</script>
```

[Try d3-ease in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-ease)

## API Reference

<a name="_ease" href="#_ease">#</a> <i>ease</i>(<i>t</i>)

Given the specified normalized time *t*, typically in the range [0,1], returns the eased time *t*, also typically in [0,1]. 0 represents the start of the animation and 1 represents the end. A good implementation returns 0 if *t* = 0 and 1 if *t* = 1. See the [easing explorer](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/248bac3b8e354a9103c4) for a visual demonstration. For example, to apply [cubic](#easeCubic) easing:

```js
var te = d3.easeCubic(t);
```

Similarly, to apply custom [elastic](#easeElastic) easing:

```js
// Before the animation starts, create your easing function.
var customElastic = d3.easeElastic.period(0.4);

// During the animation, apply the easing function.
var te = customElastic(t);
```

# d3-force

This module implements a [velocity Verlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration) numerical integrator for simulating physical forces on particles. The simulation is simplified: it assumes a constant unit time step *t* = 1 for each step, and a constant unit mass *m* = 1 for all particles. As a result, a force *F* acting on a particle is equivalent to a constant acceleration *a* over the time interval *t*, and can be simulated simply by adding to the particles velocity, which is then added to the particles position.

In the domain of information visualization, physical simulations are useful for studying [networks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048) and [hierarchies](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/95aa92e2f4e8345aaa55a4a94d41ce37)!

You can also simulate circles (disks) with collision, such as for [bubble charts](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/06/us/politics/convention-word-counts.html) or [beeswarm plots](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320):

You can even use it as a rudimentary physics engine, say to simulate cloth:

To use this module, create a [simulation](#simulation) for an array of [nodes](#simulation_nodes), and compose the desired [forces](#simulation_force). Then [listen](#simulation_on) for tick events to render the nodes as they update in your preferred graphics system, such as Canvas or SVG.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-force`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-force.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3).

## API Reference

### Simulation

<a name="forceSimulation" href="#forceSimulation">#</a> d3.<b>forceSimulation</b>([<i>nodes</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js "Source")

Creates a new simulation with the specified array of [*nodes*](#simulation_nodes) and no [forces](#simulation_force). If *nodes* is not specified, it defaults to the empty array. The simulator [starts](#simulation_restart) automatically; use [*simulation*.on](#simulation_on) to listen for tick events as the simulation runs. If you wish to run the simulation manually instead, call [*simulation*.stop](#simulation_stop), and then call [*simulation*.tick](#simulation_tick) as desired.

<a name="simulation_restart" href="#simulation_restart">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>restart</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L80 "Source")

Restarts the simulations internal timer and returns the simulation. In conjunction with [*simulation*.alphaTarget](#simulation_alphaTarget) or [*simulation*.alpha](#simulation_alpha), this method can be used to reheat the simulation during interaction, such as when dragging a node, or to resume the simulation after temporarily pausing it with [*simulation*.stop](#simulation_stop).

<a name="simulation_stop" href="#simulation_stop">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>stop</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L84 "Source")

Stops the simulations internal timer, if it is running, and returns the simulation. If the timer is already stopped, this method does nothing. This method is useful for running the simulation manually; see [*simulation*.tick](#simulation_tick).

<a name="simulation_tick" href="#simulation_tick">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>tick</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L38 "Source")

Increments the current [*alpha*](#simulation_alpha) by ([*alphaTarget*](#simulation_alphaTarget) - *alpha*)  [*alphaDecay*](#simulation_alphaDecay); then invokes each registered [force](#simulation_force), passing the new *alpha*; then decrements each [node](#simulation_nodes)s velocity by *velocity*  [*velocityDecay*](#simulation_velocityDecay); lastly increments each nodes position by *velocity*.

This method does not dispatch [events](#simulation_on); events are only dispatched by the internal timer when the simulation is started automatically upon [creation](#forceSimulation) or by calling [*simulation*.restart](#simulation_restart). The natural number of ticks when the simulation is started is *log*([*alphaMin*](#simulation_alphaMin)) / *log*(1 - [*alphaDecay*](#simulation_alphaDecay)); by default, this is 300.

This method can be used in conjunction with [*simulation*.stop](#simulation_stop) to compute a [static force layout](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667139). For large graphs, static layouts should be computed [in a web worker](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/01ab2e85e8727d6529d20391c0fd9a16) to avoid freezing the user interface.

<a name="simulation_nodes" href="#simulation_nodes">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>nodes</b>([<i>nodes</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L88 "Source")

If *nodes* is specified, sets the simulations nodes to the specified array of objects, initializing their positions and velocities if necessary, and then [re-initializes](#force_initialize) any bound [forces](#simulation_force); returns the simulation. If *nodes* is not specified, returns the simulations array of nodes as specified to the [constructor](#forceSimulation).

Each *node* must be an object. The following properties are assigned by the simulation:

* `index` - the nodes zero-based index into *nodes*
* `x` - the nodes current *x*-position
* `y` - the nodes current *y*-position
* `vx` - the nodes current *x*-velocity
* `vy` - the nodes current *y*-velocity

The position *x*,*y* and velocity *vx*,*vy* may be subsequently modified by [forces](#forces) and by the simulation. If either *vx* or *vy* is NaN, the velocity is initialized to 0,0. If either *x* or *y* is NaN, the position is initialized in a [phyllotaxis arrangement](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/11478058), so chosen to ensure a deterministic, uniform distribution around the origin.

To fix a node in a given position, you may specify two additional properties:

* `fx` - the nodes fixed *x*-position
* `fy` - the nodes fixed *y*-position

At the end of each [tick](#simulation_tick), after the application of any forces, a node with a defined *node*.fx has *node*.x reset to this value and *node*.vx set to zero; likewise, a node with a defined *node*.fy has *node*.y reset to this value and *node*.vy set to zero. To unfix a node that was previously fixed, set *node*.fx and *node*.fy to null, or delete these properties.

If the specified array of *nodes* is modified, such as when nodes are added to or removed from the simulation, this method must be called again with the new (or changed) array to notify the simulation and bound forces of the change; the simulation does not make a defensive copy of the specified array.

<a name="simulation_alpha" href="#simulation_alpha">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>alpha</b>([<i>alpha</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L92 "Source")

If *alpha* is specified, sets the current alpha to the specified number in the range [0,1] and returns this simulation. If *alpha* is not specified, returns the current alpha value, which defaults to 1.

<a name="simulation_alphaMin" href="#simulation_alphaMin">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>alphaMin</b>([<i>min</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L96 "Source")

If *min* is specified, sets the minimum *alpha* to the specified number in the range [0,1] and returns this simulation. If *min* is not specified, returns the current minimum *alpha* value, which defaults to 0.001. The simulations internal timer stops when the current [*alpha*](#simulation_alpha) is less than the minimum *alpha*. The default [alpha decay rate](#simulation_alphaDecay) of ~0.0228 corresponds to 300 iterations.

<a name="simulation_alphaDecay" href="#simulation_alphaDecay">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>alphaDecay</b>([<i>decay</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L100 "Source")

If *decay* is specified, sets the [*alpha*](#simulation_alpha) decay rate to the specified number in the range [0,1] and returns this simulation. If *decay* is not specified, returns the current *alpha* decay rate, which defaults to 0.0228 = 1 - *pow*(0.001, 1 / 300) where 0.001 is the default [minimum *alpha*](#simulation_alphaMin).

The alpha decay rate determines how quickly the current alpha interpolates towards the desired [target *alpha*](#simulation_alphaTarget); since the default target *alpha* is zero, by default this controls how quickly the simulation cools. Higher decay rates cause the simulation to stabilize more quickly, but risk getting stuck in a local minimum; lower values cause the simulation to take longer to run, but typically converge on a better layout. To have the simulation run forever at the current *alpha*, set the *decay* rate to zero; alternatively, set a [target *alpha*](#simulation_alphaTarget) greater than the [minimum *alpha*](#simulation_alphaMin).

<a name="simulation_alphaTarget" href="#simulation_alphaTarget">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>alphaTarget</b>([<i>target</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L104 "Source")

If *target* is specified, sets the current target [*alpha*](#simulation_alpha) to the specified number in the range [0,1] and returns this simulation. If *target* is not specified, returns the current target alpha value, which defaults to 0.

<a name="simulation_velocityDecay" href="#simulation_velocityDecay">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>velocityDecay</b>([<i>decay</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L108 "Source")

If *decay* is specified, sets the velocity decay factor to the specified number in the range [0,1] and returns this simulation. If *decay* is not specified, returns the current velocity decay factor, which defaults to 0.4. The decay factor is akin to atmospheric friction; after the application of any forces during a [tick](#simulation_tick), each nodes velocity is multiplied by 1 - *decay*. As with lowering the [alpha decay rate](#simulation_alphaDecay), less velocity decay may converge on a better solution, but risks numerical instabilities and oscillation.

<a name="simulation_force" href="#simulation_force">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>force</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>force</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L112 "Source")

If *force* is specified, assigns the [force](#forces) for the specified *name* and returns this simulation. If *force* is not specified, returns the force with the specified name, or undefined if there is no such force. (By default, new simulations have no forces.) For example, to create a new simulation to layout a graph, you might say:

```js
var simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
    .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody())
    .force("link", d3.forceLink(links))
    .force("center", d3.forceCenter());
```

<a name="simulation_find" href="#simulation_find">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>find</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>[, <i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L116 "Source")

Returns the node closest to the position *x*,*y* with the given search *radius*. If *radius* is not specified, it defaults to infinity. If there is no node within the search area, returns undefined.

<a name="simulation_on" href="#simulation_on">#</a> <i>simulation</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>, [<i>listener</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L139 "Source")

If *listener* is specified, sets the event *listener* for the specified *typenames* and returns this simulation. If an event listener was already registered for the same type and name, the existing listener is removed before the new listener is added. If *listener* is null, removes the current event listeners for the specified *typenames*, if any. If *listener* is not specified, returns the first currently-assigned listener matching the specified *typenames*, if any. When a specified event is dispatched, each *listener* will be invoked with the `this` context as the simulation.

The *typenames* is a string containing one or more *typename* separated by whitespace. Each *typename* is a *type*, optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a *name*, such as `tick.foo` and `tick.bar`; the name allows multiple listeners to be registered for the same *type*. The *type* must be one of the following:

* `tick` - after each tick of the simulations internal timer.
* `end` - after the simulations timer stops when *alpha* < [*alphaMin*](#simulation_alphaMin).

Note that *tick* events are not dispatched when [*simulation*.tick](#simulation_tick) is called manually; events are only dispatched by the internal timer and are intended for interactive rendering of the simulation. To affect the simulation, register [forces](#simulation_force) instead of modifying nodes positions or velocities inside a tick event listener.

See [*dispatch*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch#dispatch_on) for details.

### Forces

A *force* is simply a function that modifies nodes positions or velocities; in this context, a *force* can apply a classical physical force such as electrical charge or gravity, or it can resolve a geometric constraint, such as keeping nodes within a bounding box or keeping linked nodes a fixed distance apart. For example, a simple positioning force that moves nodes towards the origin 0,0 might be implemented as:

```js
function force(alpha) {
  for (var i = 0, n = nodes.length, node, k = alpha * 0.1; i < n; ++i) {
    node = nodes[i];
    node.vx -= node.x * k;
    node.vy -= node.y * k;
  }
}
```

Forces typically read the nodes current position *x*,*y* and then add to (or subtract from) the nodes velocity *vx*,*vy*. However, forces may also peek ahead to the anticipated next position of the node, *x* + *vx*,*y* + *vy*; this is necessary for resolving geometric constraints through [iterative relaxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_\(iterative_method\)). Forces may also modify the position directly, which is sometimes useful to avoid adding energy to the simulation, such as when recentering the simulation in the viewport.

Simulations typically compose multiple forces as desired. This module provides several for your enjoyment:

* [Centering](#centering)
* [Collision](#collision)
* [Links](#links)
* [Many-Body](#many-body)
* [Positioning](#positioning)

Forces may optionally implement [*force*.initialize](#force_initialize) to receive the simulations array of nodes.

<a name="_force" href="#_force">#</a> <i>force</i>(<i>alpha</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L44 "Source")

Applies this force, optionally observing the specified *alpha*. Typically, the force is applied to the array of nodes previously passed to [*force*.initialize](#force_initialize), however, some forces may apply to a subset of nodes, or behave differently. For example, [d3.forceLink](#links) applies to the source and target of each link.

<a name="force_initialize" href="#force_initialize">#</a> <i>force</i>.<b>initialize</b>(<i>nodes</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/simulation.js#L71 "Source")

Assigns the array of *nodes* to this force. This method is called when a force is bound to a simulation via [*simulation*.force](#simulation_force) and when the simulations nodes change via [*simulation*.nodes](#simulation_nodes). A force may perform necessary work during initialization, such as evaluating per-node parameters, to avoid repeatedly performing work during each application of the force.

#### Centering

The centering force translates nodes uniformly so that the mean position of all nodes (the center of mass if all nodes have equal weight) is at the given position [*x*](#center_x),[*y*](#center_y). This force modifies the positions of nodes on each application; it does not modify velocities, as doing so would typically cause the nodes to overshoot and oscillate around the desired center. This force helps keeps nodes in the center of the viewport, and unlike the [positioning force](#positioning), it does not distort their relative positions.

<a name="forceCenter" href="#forceCenter">#</a> d3.<b>forceCenter</b>([<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/center.js#L1 "Source")

Creates a new centering force with the specified [*x*-](#center_x) and [*y*-](#center_y) coordinates. If *x* and *y* are not specified, they default to 0,0.

<a name="center_x" href="#center_x">#</a> <i>center</i>.<b>x</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/center.js#L27 "Source")

If *x* is specified, sets the *x*-coordinate of the centering position to the specified number and returns this force. If *x* is not specified, returns the current *x*-coordinate, which defaults to zero.

<a name="center_y" href="#center_y">#</a> <i>center</i>.<b>y</b>([<i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/center.js#L31 "Source")

If *y* is specified, sets the *y*-coordinate of the centering position to the specified number and returns this force. If *y* is not specified, returns the current *y*-coordinate, which defaults to zero.

#### Collision

The collision force treats nodes as circles with a given [radius](#collide_radius), rather than points, and prevents nodes from overlapping. More formally, two nodes *a* and *b* are separated so that the distance between *a* and *b* is at least *radius*(*a*) + *radius*(*b*). To reduce jitter, this is by default a soft constraint with a configurable [strength](#collide_strength) and [iteration count](#collide_iterations).

<a name="forceCollide" href="#forceCollide">#</a> d3.<b>forceCollide</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/collide.js "Source")

Creates a new circle collision force with the specified [*radius*](#collide_radius). If *radius* is not specified, it defaults to the constant one for all nodes.

<a name="collide_radius" href="#collide_radius">#</a> <i>collide</i>.<b>radius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/collide.js#L86 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the radius accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the radius accessor for each node, and returns this force. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current radius accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function radius() {
  return 1;
}
```

The radius accessor is invoked for each [node](#simulation_nodes) in the simulation, being passed the *node* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the radius of each node is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *radius*, and not on every application of the force.

<a name="collide_strength" href="#collide_strength">#</a> <i>collide</i>.<b>strength</b>([<i>strength</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/collide.js#L82 "Source")

If *strength* is specified, sets the force strength to the specified number in the range [0,1] and returns this force. If *strength* is not specified, returns the current strength which defaults to 0.7.

Overlapping nodes are resolved through iterative relaxation. For each node, the other nodes that are anticipated to overlap at the next tick (using the anticipated positions *x* + *vx*,*y* + *vy*) are determined; the nodes velocity is then modified to push the node out of each overlapping node. The change in velocity is dampened by the forces strength such that the resolution of simultaneous overlaps can be blended together to find a stable solution.

<a name="collide_iterations" href="#collide_iterations">#</a> <i>collide</i>.<b>iterations</b>([<i>iterations</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/collide.js#L78 "Source")

If *iterations* is specified, sets the number of iterations per application to the specified number and returns this force. If *iterations* is not specified, returns the current iteration count which defaults to 1. Increasing the number of iterations greatly increases the rigidity of the constraint and avoids partial overlap of nodes, but also increases the runtime cost to evaluate the force.

#### Links

The link force pushes linked nodes together or apart according to the desired [link distance](#link_distance). The strength of the force is proportional to the difference between the linked nodes distance and the target distance, similar to a spring force.

<a name="forceLink" href="#forceLink">#</a> d3.<b>forceLink</b>([<i>links</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/link.js "Source")

Creates a new link force with the specified *links* and default parameters. If *links* is not specified, it defaults to the empty array.

<a name="link_links" href="#link_links">#</a> <i>link</i>.<b>links</b>([<i>links</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/link.js#L92 "Source")

If *links* is specified, sets the array of links associated with this force, recomputes the [distance](#link_distance) and [strength](#link_strength) parameters for each link, and returns this force. If *links* is not specified, returns the current array of links, which defaults to the empty array.

Each link is an object with the following properties:

* `source` - the links source node; see [*simulation*.nodes](#simulation_nodes)
* `target` - the links target node; see [*simulation*.nodes](#simulation_nodes)
* `index` - the zero-based index into *links*, assigned by this method

For convenience, a links source and target properties may be initialized using numeric or string identifiers rather than object references; see [*link*.id](#link_id).

If the specified array of *links* is modified, such as when links are added to or removed from the simulation, this method must be called again with the new (or changed) array to notify the force of the change; the force does not make a defensive copy of the specified array.

<a name="link_id" href="#link_id">#</a> <i>link</i>.<b>id</b>([<i>id</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/link.js#L96 "Source")

If *id* is specified, sets the node id accessor to the specified function and returns this force. If *id* is not specified, returns the current node id accessor, which defaults to the numeric *node*.index:

```js
function id(d) {
  return d.index;
}
```

The default id accessor allows each links source and target to be specified as a zero-based index into the [nodes](#simulation_nodes) array. For example:

```js
var nodes = [
  {"id": "Alice"},
  {"id": "Bob"},
  {"id": "Carol"}
];

var links = [
  {"source": 0, "target": 1}, // Alice  Bob
  {"source": 1, "target": 2} // Bob  Carol
];
```

Now consider a different id accessor that returns a string:

```js
function id(d) {
  return d.id;
}
```

With this accessor, you can use named sources and targets:

```js
var nodes = [
  {"id": "Alice"},
  {"id": "Bob"},
  {"id": "Carol"}
];

var links = [
  {"source": "Alice", "target": "Bob"},
  {"source": "Bob", "target": "Carol"}
];
```

This is particularly useful when representing graphs in JSON, as JSON does not allow references. See [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/f584aa36df54c451c94a9d0798caed35).

The id accessor is invoked for each node whenever the force is initialized, as when the [nodes](#simulation_nodes) or [links](#link_links) change, being passed the node and its zero-based index.

<a name="link_distance" href="#link_distance">#</a> <i>link</i>.<b>distance</b>([<i>distance</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/link.js#L108 "Source")

If *distance* is specified, sets the distance accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the distance accessor for each link, and returns this force. If *distance* is not specified, returns the current distance accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function distance() {
  return 30;
}
```

The distance accessor is invoked for each [link](#link_links), being passed the *link* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the distance of each link is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *distance*, and not on every application of the force.

<a name="link_strength" href="#link_strength">#</a> <i>link</i>.<b>strength</b>([<i>strength</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/link.js#L104 "Source")

If *strength* is specified, sets the strength accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the strength accessor for each link, and returns this force. If *strength* is not specified, returns the current strength accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function strength(link) {
  return 1 / Math.min(count(link.source), count(link.target));
}
```

Where *count*(*node*) is a function that returns the number of links with the given node as a source or target. This default was chosen because it automatically reduces the strength of links connected to heavily-connected nodes, improving stability.

The strength accessor is invoked for each [link](#link_links), being passed the *link* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the strength of each link is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *strength*, and not on every application of the force.

<a name="link_iterations" href="#link_iterations">#</a> <i>link</i>.<b>iterations</b>([<i>iterations</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/link.js#L100 "Source")

If *iterations* is specified, sets the number of iterations per application to the specified number and returns this force. If *iterations* is not specified, returns the current iteration count which defaults to 1. Increasing the number of iterations greatly increases the rigidity of the constraint and is useful for [complex structures such as lattices](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1b64ec067fcfc51e7471d944f51f1611), but also increases the runtime cost to evaluate the force.

#### Many-Body

The many-body (or *n*-body) force applies mutually amongst all [nodes](#simulation_nodes). It can be used to simulate gravity (attraction) if the [strength](#manyBody_strength) is positive, or electrostatic charge (repulsion) if the strength is negative. This implementation uses quadtrees and the [BarnesHut approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarnesHut_simulation) to greatly improve performance; the accuracy can be customized using the [theta](#manyBody_theta) parameter.

Unlike links, which only affect two linked nodes, the charge force is global: every node affects every other node, even if they are on disconnected subgraphs.

<a name="forceManyBody" href="#forceManyBody">#</a> d3.<b>forceManyBody</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/manyBody.js "Source")

Creates a new many-body force with the default parameters.

<a name="manyBody_strength" href="#manyBody_strength">#</a> <i>manyBody</i>.<b>strength</b>([<i>strength</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/manyBody.js#L97 "Source")

If *strength* is specified, sets the strength accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the strength accessor for each node, and returns this force. A positive value causes nodes to attract each other, similar to gravity, while a negative value causes nodes to repel each other, similar to electrostatic charge. If *strength* is not specified, returns the current strength accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function strength() {
  return -30;
}
```

The strength accessor is invoked for each [node](#simulation_nodes) in the simulation, being passed the *node* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the strength of each node is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *strength*, and not on every application of the force.

<a name="manyBody_theta" href="#manyBody_theta">#</a> <i>manyBody</i>.<b>theta</b>([<i>theta</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/manyBody.js#L109 "Source")

If *theta* is specified, sets the BarnesHut approximation criterion to the specified number and returns this force. If *theta* is not specified, returns the current value, which defaults to 0.9.

To accelerate computation, this force implements the [BarnesHut approximation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarnesHut_simulation) which takes O(*n* log *n*) per application where *n* is the number of [nodes](#simulation_nodes). For each application, a [quadtree](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree) stores the current node positions; then for each node, the combined force of all other nodes on the given node is computed. For a cluster of nodes that is far away, the charge force can be approximated by treating the cluster as a single, larger node. The *theta* parameter determines the accuracy of the approximation: if the ratio *w* / *l* of the width *w* of the quadtree cell to the distance *l* from the node to the cells center of mass is less than *theta*, all nodes in the given cell are treated as a single node rather than individually.

<a name="manyBody_distanceMin" href="#manyBody_distanceMin">#</a> <i>manyBody</i>.<b>distanceMin</b>([<i>distance</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/manyBody.js#L101 "Source")

If *distance* is specified, sets the minimum distance between nodes over which this force is considered. If *distance* is not specified, returns the current minimum distance, which defaults to 1. A minimum distance establishes an upper bound on the strength of the force between two nearby nodes, avoiding instability. In particular, it avoids an infinitely-strong force if two nodes are exactly coincident; in this case, the direction of the force is random.

<a name="manyBody_distanceMax" href="#manyBody_distanceMax">#</a> <i>manyBody</i>.<b>distanceMax</b>([<i>distance</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/manyBody.js#L105 "Source")

If *distance* is specified, sets the maximum distance between nodes over which this force is considered. If *distance* is not specified, returns the current maximum distance, which defaults to infinity. Specifying a finite maximum distance improves performance and produces a more localized layout.

#### Positioning

The [*x*](#forceX)- and [*y*](#forceY)-positioning forces push nodes towards a desired position along the given dimension with a configurable strength. The strength of the force is proportional to the one-dimensional distance between the nodes position and the target position. While these forces can be used to position individual nodes, they are intended primarily for global forces that apply to all (or most) nodes.

<a name="forceX" href="#forceX">#</a> d3.<b>forceX</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/x.js "Source")

Creates a new positioning force along the *x*-axis towards the given position [*x*](#x_x). If *x* is not specified, it defaults to 0.

<a name="x_strength" href="#x_strength">#</a> <i>x</i>.<b>strength</b>([<i>strength</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/x.js#L32 "Source")

If *strength* is specified, sets the strength accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the strength accessor for each node, and returns this force. The *strength* determines how much to increment the nodes *x*-velocity: ([*x*](#x_x) - *node*.x)  *strength*. For example, a value of 0.1 indicates that the node should move a tenth of the way from its current *x*-position to the target *x*-position with each application. Higher values moves nodes more quickly to the target position, often at the expense of other forces or constraints. A value outside the range [0,1] is not recommended.

If *strength* is not specified, returns the current strength accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function strength() {
  return 0.1;
}
```

The strength accessor is invoked for each [node](#simulation_nodes) in the simulation, being passed the *node* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the strength of each node is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *strength*, and not on every application of the force.

<a name="x_x" href="#x_x">#</a> <i>x</i>.<b>x</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/x.js#L36 "Source")

If *x* is specified, sets the *x*-coordinate accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the *x*-accessor for each node, and returns this force. If *x* is not specified, returns the current *x*-accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function x() {
  return 0;
}
```

The *x*-accessor is invoked for each [node](#simulation_nodes) in the simulation, being passed the *node* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the target *x*-coordinate of each node is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *x*, and not on every application of the force.

<a name="forceY" href="#forceY">#</a> d3.<b>forceY</b>([<i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/y.js "Source")

Creates a new positioning force along the *y*-axis towards the given position [*y*](#y_y). If *y* is not specified, it defaults to 0.

<a name="y_strength" href="#y_strength">#</a> <i>y</i>.<b>strength</b>([<i>strength</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/y.js#L32 "Source")

If *strength* is specified, sets the strength accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the strength accessor for each node, and returns this force. The *strength* determines how much to increment the nodes *y*-velocity: ([*y*](#y_y) - *node*.y)  *strength*. For example, a value of 0.1 indicates that the node should move a tenth of the way from its current *y*-position to the target *y*-position with each application. Higher values moves nodes more quickly to the target position, often at the expense of other forces or constraints. A value outside the range [0,1] is not recommended.

If *strength* is not specified, returns the current strength accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function strength() {
  return 0.1;
}
```

The strength accessor is invoked for each [node](#simulation_nodes) in the simulation, being passed the *node* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the strength of each node is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *strength*, and not on every application of the force.

<a name="y_y" href="#y_y">#</a> <i>y</i>.<b>y</b>([<i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/src/y.js#L36 "Source")

If *y* is specified, sets the *y*-coordinate accessor to the specified number or function, re-evaluates the *y*-accessor for each node, and returns this force. If *y* is not specified, returns the current *y*-accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function y() {
  return 0;
}
```

The *y*-accessor is invoked for each [node](#simulation_nodes) in the simulation, being passed the *node* and its zero-based *index*. The resulting number is then stored internally, such that the target *y*-coordinate of each node is only recomputed when the force is initialized or when this method is called with a new *y*, and not on every application of the force.

# d3-format

Ever noticed how sometimes JavaScript doesnt display numbers the way you expect? Like, you tried to print tenths with a simple loop:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(0.1 * i);
}
```

And you got this:

```js
0
0.1
0.2
0.30000000000000004
0.4
0.5
0.6000000000000001
0.7000000000000001
0.8
0.9
```

Welcome to [binary floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)! _

Yet rounding error is not the only reason to customize number formatting. A table of numbers should be formatted consistently for comparison; above, 0.0 would be better than 0. Large numbers should have grouped digits (e.g., 42,000) or be in scientific or metric notation (4.2e+4, 42k). Currencies should have fixed precision ($3.50). Reported numerical results should be rounded to significant digits (4021 becomes 4000). Number formats should appropriate to the readers locale (42.000,00 or 42,000.00). The list goes on.

Formatting numbers for human consumption is the purpose of d3-format, which is modeled after Python 3s [format specification mini-language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language) ([PEP 3101](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/)). Revisiting the example above:

```js
var f = d3.format(".1f");
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(f(0.1 * i));
}
```

Now you get this:

```js
0.0
0.1
0.2
0.3
0.4
0.5
0.6
0.7
0.8
0.9
```

But d3-format is much more than an alias for [number.toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed)! A few more examples:

```js
d3.format(".0%")(0.123);  // rounded percentage, "12%"
d3.format("($.2f")(-3.5); // localized fixed-point currency, "(3.50)"
d3.format("+20")(42);     // space-filled and signed, "                 +42"
d3.format(".^20")(42);    // dot-filled and centered, ".........42........."
d3.format(".2s")(42e6);   // SI-prefix with two significant digits, "42M"
d3.format("#x")(48879);   // prefixed lowercase hexadecimal, "0xbeef"
d3.format(",.2r")(4223);  // grouped thousands with two significant digits, "4,200"
```

See [*locale*.format](#locale_format) for a detailed specification, and try running [d3.formatSpecifier](#formatSpecifier) on the above formats to decode their meaning.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-format`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-format.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-format.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var format = d3.format(".2s");

</script>
```

Locale files are hosted on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) and can be loaded using [d3.json](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#json). For example, to set Russian as the default locale:

```js
d3.json("https://unpkg.com/d3-format@1/locale/ru-RU.json", function(error, locale) {
  if (error) throw error;

  d3.formatDefaultLocale(locale);

  var format = d3.format("$,");

  console.log(format(1234.56)); // 1234,56.
});
```

## API Reference

<a name="format" href="#format">#</a> d3.<b>format</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/defaultLocale.js#L4 "Source")

An alias for [*locale*.format](#locale_format) on the [default locale](#formatDefaultLocale).

<a name="formatPrefix" href="#formatPrefix">#</a> d3.<b>formatPrefix</b>(<i>specifier</i>, <i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/defaultLocale.js#L5 "Source")

An alias for [*locale*.formatPrefix](#locale_formatPrefix) on the [default locale](#formatDefaultLocale).

<a name="locale_format" href="#locale_format">#</a> <i>locale</i>.<b>format</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/locale.js#L18 "Source")

Returns a new format function for the given string *specifier*. The returned function takes a number as the only argument, and returns a string representing the formatted number. The general form of a specifier is:

```
[[fill]align][sign][symbol][0][width][,][.precision][type]
```

The *fill* can be any character. The presence of a fill character is signaled by the *align* character following it, which must be one of the following:

* `>` - Forces the field to be right-aligned within the available space. (Default behavior).
* `<` - Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space.
* `^` - Forces the field to be centered within the available space.
* `=` - like `>`, but with any sign and symbol to the left of any padding.

The *sign* can be:

* `-` - nothing for positive and a minus sign for negative. (Default behavior.)
* `+` - a plus sign for positive and a minus sign for negative.
* `(` - nothing for positive and parentheses for negative.
* `` (space) - a space for positive and a minus sign for negative.

The *symbol* can be:

* `$` - apply currency symbols per the locale definition.
* `#` - for binary, octal, or hexadecimal notation, prefix by `0b`, `0o`, or `0x`, respectively.

The *zero* (`0`) option enables zero-padding; this implicitly sets *fill* to `0` and *align* to `=`. The *width* defines the minimum field width; if not specified, then the width will be determined by the content. The *comma* (`,`) option enables the use of a group separator, such as a comma for thousands.

Depending on the *type*, the *precision* either indicates the number of digits that follow the decimal point (types `f` and `%`), or the number of significant digits (types ``, `e`, `g`, `r`, `s` and `p`). If the precision is not specified, it defaults to 6 for all types except `` (none), which defaults to 12. Precision is ignored for integer formats (types `b`, `o`, `d`, `x`, `X` and `c`). See [precisionFixed](#precisionFixed) and [precisionRound](#precisionRound) for help picking an appropriate precision.

The available *type* values are:

* `e` - exponent notation.
* `f` - fixed point notation.
* `g` - either decimal or exponent notation, rounded to significant digits.
* `r` - decimal notation, rounded to significant digits.
* `s` - decimal notation with an [SI prefix](#locale_formatPrefix), rounded to significant digits.
* `%` - multiply by 100, and then decimal notation with a percent sign.
* `p` - multiply by 100, round to significant digits, and then decimal notation with a percent sign.
* `b` - binary notation, rounded to integer.
* `o` - octal notation, rounded to integer.
* `d` - decimal notation, rounded to integer.
* `x` - hexadecimal notation, using lower-case letters, rounded to integer.
* `X` - hexadecimal notation, using upper-case letters, rounded to integer.
* `c` - converts the integer to the corresponding unicode character before printing.
* `` (none) - like `g`, but trim insignificant trailing zeros.

The type `n` is also supported as shorthand for `,g`. For the `g`, `n` and `` (none) types, decimal notation is used if the resulting string would have *precision* or fewer digits; otherwise, exponent notation is used. For example:

```js
d3.format(".2")(42);  // "42"
d3.format(".2")(4.2); // "4.2"
d3.format(".1")(42);  // "4e+1"
d3.format(".1")(4.2); // "4"
```

<a name="locale_formatPrefix" href="#locale_formatPrefix">#</a> <i>locale</i>.<b>formatPrefix</b>(<i>specifier</i>, <i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/locale.js#L127 "Source")

Equivalent to [*locale*.format](#locale_format), except the returned function will convert values to the units of the appropriate [SI prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix#List_of_SI_prefixes) for the specified numeric reference *value* before formatting in fixed point notation. The following prefixes are supported:

* `y` - yocto, 10
* `z` - zepto, 10
* `a` - atto, 10
* `f` - femto, 10
* `p` - pico, 10
* `n` - nano, 10
* `` - micro, 10
* `m` - milli, 10
* `` (none) - 10
* `k` - kilo, 10
* `M` - mega, 10
* `G` - giga, 10
* `T` - tera, 10
* `P` - peta, 10
* `E` - exa, 10
* `Z` - zetta, 10
* `Y` - yotta, 10

Unlike [*locale*.format](#locale_format) with the `s` format type, this method returns a formatter with a consistent SI prefix, rather than computing the prefix dynamically for each number. In addition, the *precision* for the given *specifier* represents the number of digits past the decimal point (as with `f` fixed point notation), not the number of significant digits. For example:

```js
var f = d3.formatPrefix(",.0", 1e-6);
f(0.00042); // "420"
f(0.0042); // "4,200"
```

This method is useful when formatting multiple numbers in the same units for easy comparison. See [precisionPrefix](#precisionPrefix) for help picking an appropriate precision, and [bl.ocks.org/9764126](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9764126) for an example.

<a name="formatSpecifier" href="#formatSpecifier">#</a> d3.<b>formatSpecifier</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/formatSpecifier.js "Source")

Parses the specified *specifier*, returning an object with exposed fields that correspond to the [format specification mini-language](#locale_format) and a toString method that reconstructs the specifier. For example, `formatSpecifier("s")` returns:

```js
{
  "fill": " ",
  "align": ">",
  "sign": "-",
  "symbol": "",
  "zero": false,
  "width": undefined,
  "comma": false,
  "precision": 6,
  "type": "s"
}
```

This method is useful for understanding how format specifiers are parsed and for deriving new specifiers. For example, you might compute an appropriate precision based on the numbers you want to format using [precisionFixed](#precisionFixed) and then create a new format:

```js
var s = d3.formatSpecifier("f");
s.precision = precisionFixed(0.01);
var f = d3.format(s);
f(42); // "42.00";
```

<a name="precisionFixed" href="#precisionFixed">#</a> d3.<b>precisionFixed</b>(<i>step</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/precisionFixed.js "Source")

Returns a suggested decimal precision for fixed point notation given the specified numeric *step* value. The *step* represents the minimum absolute difference between values that will be formatted. (This assumes that the values to be formatted are also multiples of *step*.) For example, given the numbers 1, 1.5, and 2, the *step* should be 0.5 and the suggested precision is 1:

```js
var p = d3.precisionFixed(0.5),
    f = d3.format("." + p + "f");
f(1);   // "1.0"
f(1.5); // "1.5"
f(2);   // "2.0"
```

Whereas for the numbers 1, 2 and 3, the *step* should be 1 and the suggested precision is 0:

```js
var p = d3.precisionFixed(1),
    f = d3.format("." + p + "f");
f(1); // "1"
f(2); // "2"
f(3); // "3"
```

Note: for the `%` format type, subtract two:

```js
var p = Math.max(0, d3.precisionFixed(0.05) - 2),
    f = d3.format("." + p + "%");
f(0.45); // "45%"
f(0.50); // "50%"
f(0.55); // "55%"
```

<a name="precisionPrefix" href="#precisionPrefix">#</a> d3.<b>precisionPrefix</b>(<i>step</i>, <i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/precisionPrefix.js "Source")

Returns a suggested decimal precision for use with [*locale*.formatPrefix](#locale_formatPrefix) given the specified numeric *step* and reference *value*. The *step* represents the minimum absolute difference between values that will be formatted, and *value* determines which SI prefix will be used. (This assumes that the values to be formatted are also multiples of *step*.) For example, given the numbers 1.1e6, 1.2e6, and 1.3e6, the *step* should be 1e5, the *value* could be 1.3e6, and the suggested precision is 1:

```js
var p = d3.precisionPrefix(1e5, 1.3e6),
    f = d3.formatPrefix("." + p, 1.3e6);
f(1.1e6); // "1.1M"
f(1.2e6); // "1.2M"
f(1.3e6); // "1.3M"
```

<a name="precisionRound" href="#precisionRound">#</a> d3.<b>precisionRound</b>(<i>step</i>, <i>max</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/precisionRound.js "Source")

Returns a suggested decimal precision for format types that round to significant digits given the specified numeric *step* and *max* values. The *step* represents the minimum absolute difference between values that will be formatted, and the *max* represents the largest absolute value that will be formatted. (This assumes that the values to be formatted are also multiples of *step*.) For example, given the numbers 0.99, 1.0, and 1.01, the *step* should be 0.01, the *max* should be 1.01, and the suggested precision is 3:

```js
var p = d3.precisionRound(0.01, 1.01),
    f = d3.format("." + p + "r");
f(0.99); // "0.990"
f(1.0);  // "1.00"
f(1.01); // "1.01"
```

Whereas for the numbers 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, the *step* should be 0.1, the *max* should be 1.1, and the suggested precision is 2:

```js
var p = d3.precisionRound(0.1, 1.1),
    f = d3.format("." + p + "r");
f(0.9); // "0.90"
f(1.0); // "1.0"
f(1.1); // "1.1"
```

Note: for the `e` format type, subtract one:

```js
var p = Math.max(0, d3.precisionRound(0.01, 1.01) - 1),
    f = d3.format("." + p + "e");
f(0.01); // "1.00e-2"
f(1.01); // "1.01e+0"
```

### Locales

<a name="formatLocale" href="#formatLocale">#</a> d3.<b>formatLocale</b>(<i>definition</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/locale.js "Source")

Returns a *locale* object for the specified *definition* with [*locale*.format](#locale_format) and [*locale*.formatPrefix](#locale_formatPrefix) methods. The *definition* must include the following properties:

* `decimal` - the decimal point (e.g., `"."`).
* `thousands` - the group separator (e.g., `","`).
* `grouping` - the array of group sizes (e.g., `[3]`), cycled as needed.
* `currency` - the currency prefix and suffix (e.g., `["$", ""]`).
* `numerals` - optional; an array of ten strings to replace the numerals 0-9.
* `percent` - optional; the percent suffix (defaults to `"%"`).

Note that the *thousands* property is a misnomer, as the grouping definition allows groups other than thousands.

<a name="formatDefaultLocale" href="#formatDefaultLocale">#</a> d3.<b>formatDefaultLocale</b>(<i>definition</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/src/defaultLocale.js "Source")

Equivalent to [d3.formatLocale](#formatLocale), except it also redefines [d3.format](#format) and [d3.formatPrefix](#formatPrefix) to the new locales [*locale*.format](#locale_format) and [*locale*.formatPrefix](#locale_formatPrefix). If you do not set a default locale, it defaults to [U.S. English](https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/locale/en-US.json).

# d3-geo

Map projections are sometimes implemented as point transformations. For instance, spherical Mercator:

```js
function mercator(x, y) {
  return [x, Math.log(Math.tan(Math.PI / 4 + y / 2))];
}
```

This is a reasonable *mathematical* approach if your geometry consists of continuous, infinite point sets. Yet computers do not have infinite memory, so we must instead work with discrete geometry such as polygons and polylines!

Discrete geometry makes the challenge of projecting from the sphere to the plane much harder. The edges of a spherical polygon are [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic) (segments of great circles), not straight lines. Projected to the plane, geodesics are curves in all map projections except [gnomonic](#geoGnomonic), and thus accurate projection requires interpolation along each arc. D3 uses [adaptive sampling](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3795544) inspired by a popular [line simplification method](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/) to balance accuracy and performance.

The projection of polygons and polylines must also deal with the topological differences between the sphere and the plane. Some projections require cutting geometry that [crosses the antimeridian](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3788999), while others require [clipping geometry to a great circle](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3021474).

Spherical polygons also require a [winding order convention](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/a7bdfeb041e850799a8d3dce4d8c50c8) to determine which side of the polygon is the inside: the exterior ring for polygons smaller than a hemisphere must be clockwise, while the exterior ring for polygons [larger than a hemisphere](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6713736) must be anticlockwise. Interior rings representing holes must use the opposite winding order of their exterior ring. This winding order convention is also used by [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson) and [ESRI shapefiles](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile); however, it is the **opposite** convention of GeoJSONs [RFC 7946](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.6). (Also note that standard GeoJSON WGS84 uses planar equirectangular coordinates, not spherical coordinates, and thus may require [stitching](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection/blob/master/README.md#geostitch) to remove antimeridian cuts.)

D3s approach affords great expressiveness: you can choose the right projection, and the right aspect, for your data. D3 supports a wide variety of common and [unusual map projections](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection). For more, see Part 2 of [The Toolmakers Guide](https://vimeo.com/106198518#t=20m0s).

D3 uses [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) to represent geographic features in JavaScript. (See also [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson), an extension of GeoJSON that is significantly more compact and encodes topology.) To convert shapefiles to GeoJSON, use [shp2geo](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile/blob/master/README.md#shp2geo), part of the [shapefile package](https://github.com/mbostock/shapefile). See [Command-Line Cartography](https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-1-897aa8f8ca2c) for an introduction to d3-geo and related tools.

### Paths

The geographic path generator, [d3.geoPath](#geoPath), is similar to the shape generators in [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape): given a GeoJSON geometry or feature object, it generates an SVG path data string or [renders the path to a Canvas](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3783604). Canvas is recommended for dynamic or interactive projections to improve performance. Paths can be used with [projections](#projections) or [transforms](#transforms), or they can be used to render planar geometry directly to Canvas or SVG.

<a href="#geoPath" name="geoPath">#</a> d3.<b>geoPath</b>([<i>projection</i>[, <i>context</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/index.js "Source")

Creates a new geographic path generator with the default settings. If *projection* is specified, sets the [current projection](#path_projection). If *context* is specified, sets the [current context](#path_context).

<a href="#_path" name="_path">#</a> <i>path</i>(<i>object</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/index.js#L15 "Source")

Renders the given *object*, which may be any GeoJSON feature or geometry object:

* Point - a single position.
* MultiPoint - an array of positions.
* LineString - an array of positions forming a continuous line.
* MultiLineString - an array of arrays of positions forming several lines.
* Polygon - an array of arrays of positions forming a polygon (possibly with holes).
* MultiPolygon - a multidimensional array of positions forming multiple polygons.
* GeometryCollection - an array of geometry objects.
* Feature - a feature containing one of the above geometry objects.
* FeatureCollection - an array of feature objects.

The type *Sphere* is also supported, which is useful for rendering the outline of the globe; a sphere has no coordinates. Any additional *arguments* are passed along to the [pointRadius](#path_pointRadius) accessor.

To display multiple features, combine them into a feature collection:

```js
svg.append("path")
    .datum({type: "FeatureCollection", features: features})
    .attr("d", d3.geoPath());
```

Or use multiple path elements:

```js
svg.selectAll("path")
  .data(features)
  .enter().append("path")
    .attr("d", d3.geoPath());
```

Separate path elements are typically slower than a single path element. However, distinct path elements are useful for styling and interaction (e.g., click or mouseover). Canvas rendering (see [*path*.context](#path_context)) is typically faster than SVG, but requires more effort to implement styling and interaction.

<a href="#path_area" name="path_area">#</a> <i>path</i>.<b>area</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/area.js "Source")

Returns the projected planar area (typically in square pixels) for the specified GeoJSON *object*. Point, MultiPoint, LineString and MultiLineString geometries have zero area. For Polygon and MultiPolygon geometries, this method first computes the area of the exterior ring, and then subtracts the area of any interior holes. This method observes any clipping performed by the [projection](#path_projection); see [*projection*.clipAngle](#projection_clipAngle) and [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent). This is the planar equivalent of [d3.geoArea](#geoArea).

<a href="#path_bounds" name="path_bounds">#</a> <i>path</i>.<b>bounds</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/bounds.js "Source")

Returns the projected planar bounding box (typically in pixels) for the specified GeoJSON *object*. The bounding box is represented by a two-dimensional array: \[\[*x*, *y*\], \[*x*, *y*\]\], where *x* is the minimum *x*-coordinate, *y* is the minimum *y*-coordinate, *x* is maximum *x*-coordinate, and *y* is the maximum *y*-coordinate. This is handy for, say, zooming in to a particular feature. (Note that in projected planar coordinates, the minimum latitude is typically the maximum *y*-value, and the maximum latitude is typically the minimum *y*-value.) This method observes any clipping performed by the [projection](#path_projection); see [*projection*.clipAngle](#projection_clipAngle) and [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent). This is the planar equivalent of [d3.geoBounds](#geoBounds).

<a href="#path_centroid" name="path_centroid">#</a> <i>path</i>.<b>centroid</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/centroid.js "Source")

Returns the projected planar centroid (typically in pixels) for the specified GeoJSON *object*. This is handy for, say, labeling state or county boundaries, or displaying a symbol map. For example, a [noncontiguous cartogram](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4055908) might scale each state around its centroid. This method observes any clipping performed by the [projection](#path_projection); see [*projection*.clipAngle](#projection_clipAngle) and [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent). This is the planar equivalent of [d3.geoCentroid](#geoCentroid).

<a href="#path_measure" name="path_measure">#</a> <i>path</i>.<b>measure</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/measure.js "Source")

Returns the projected planar length (typically in pixels) for the specified GeoJSON *object*. Point and MultiPoint geometries have zero length. For Polygon and MultiPolygon geometries, this method computes the summed length of all rings. This method observes any clipping performed by the [projection](#path_projection); see [*projection*.clipAngle](#projection_clipAngle) and [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent). This is the planar equivalent of [d3.geoLength](#geoLength).

<a href="#path_projection" name="path_projection">#</a> <i>path</i>.<b>projection</b>([<i>projection</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/index.js#L48 "Source")

If a *projection* is specified, sets the current projection to the specified projection. If *projection* is not specified, returns the current projection, which defaults to null. The null projection represents the identity transformation: the input geometry is not projected and is instead rendered directly in raw coordinates. This can be useful for fast rendering of [pre-projected geometry](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5557726), or for fast rendering of the equirectangular projection.

The given *projection* is typically one of D3s built-in [geographic projections](#projections); however, any object that exposes a [*projection*.stream](#projection_stream) function can be used, enabling the use of [custom projections](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5663666). See D3s [transforms](#transforms) for more examples of arbitrary geometric transformations.

<a href="#path_context" name="path_context">#</a> <i>path</i>.<b>context</b>([<i>context</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/index.js#L52 "Source")

If *context* is specified, sets the current render context and returns the path generator. If the *context* is null, then the [path generator](#_path) will return an SVG path string; if the context is non-null, the path generator will instead call methods on the specified context to render geometry. The context must implement the following subset of the [CanvasRenderingContext2D API](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvasrenderingcontext2d):

* *context*.beginPath()
* *context*.moveTo(*x*, *y*)
* *context*.lineTo(*x*, *y*)
* *context*.arc(*x*, *y*, *radius*, *startAngle*, *endAngle*)
* *context*.closePath()

If a *context* is not specified, returns the current render context which defaults to null.

<a href="#path_pointRadius" name="path_pointRadius">#</a> <i>path</i>.<b>pointRadius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/path/index.js#L59 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the radius used to display Point and MultiPoint geometries to the specified number. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current radius accessor, which defaults to 4.5. While the radius is commonly specified as a number constant, it may also be specified as a function which is computed per feature, being passed the any arguments passed to the [path generator](#_path). For example, if your GeoJSON data has additional properties, you might access those properties inside the radius function to vary the point size; alternatively, you could [d3.symbol](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#symbols) and a [projection](#geoProjection) for greater flexibility.

### Projections

Projections transform spherical polygonal geometry to planar polygonal geometry. D3 provides implementations of several classes of standard projections:

* [Azimuthal](#azimuthal-projections)
* [Composite](#composite-projections)
* [Conic](#conic-projections)
* [Cylindrical](#cylindrical-projections)

For many more projections, see [d3-geo-projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection). You can implement [custom projections](#raw-projections) using [d3.geoProjection](#geoProjection) or [d3.geoProjectionMutator](#geoProjectionMutator).

<a href="#_projection" name="_projection">#</a> <i>projection</i>(<i>point</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L34 "Source")

Returns a new array \[*x*, *y*\] (typically in pixels) representing the projected point of the given *point*. The point must be specified as a two-element array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees. May return null if the specified *point* has no defined projected position, such as when the point is outside the clipping bounds of the projection.

<a href="#projection_invert" name="projection_invert">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>invert</b>(<i>point</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L39 "Source")

Returns a new array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees representing the unprojected point of the given projected *point*. The point must be specified as a two-element array \[*x*, *y*\] (typically in pixels). May return null if the specified *point* has no defined projected position, such as when the point is outside the clipping bounds of the projection.

This method is only defined on invertible projections.

<a href="#projection_stream" name="projection_stream">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>stream</b>(<i>stream</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L48 "Source")

Returns a [projection stream](#streams) for the specified output *stream*. Any input geometry is projected before being streamed to the output stream. A typical projection involves several geometry transformations: the input geometry is first converted to radians, rotated on three axes, clipped to the small circle or cut along the antimeridian, and lastly projected to the plane with adaptive resampling, scale and translation.

<a href="#projection_clipAngle" name="projection_clipAngle">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>clipAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L52 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the projections clipping circle radius to the specified angle in degrees and returns the projection. If *angle* is null, switches to [antimeridian cutting](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3788999) rather than small-circle clipping. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current clip angle which defaults to null. Small-circle clipping is independent of viewport clipping via [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent).

<a href="#projection_clipExtent" name="projection_clipExtent">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>clipExtent</b>([<i>extent</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L56 "Source")

If *extent* is specified, sets the projections viewport clip extent to the specified bounds in pixels and returns the projection. The *extent* bounds are specified as an array \[\[<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>\], \[<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>\]\], where <i>x</i> is the left-side of the viewport, <i>y</i> is the top, <i>x</i> is the right and <i>y</i> is the bottom. If *extent* is null, no viewport clipping is performed. If *extent* is not specified, returns the current viewport clip extent which defaults to null. Viewport clipping is independent of small-circle clipping via [*projection*.clipAngle](#projection_clipAngle).

<a href="#projection_scale" name="projection_scale">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>scale</b>([<i>scale</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L60 "Source")

If *scale* is specified, sets the projections scale factor to the specified value and returns the projection. If *scale* is not specified, returns the current scale factor; the default scale is projection-specific. The scale factor corresponds linearly to the distance between projected points; however, absolute scale factors are not equivalent across projections.

<a href="#projection_translate" name="projection_translate">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>translate</b>([<i>translate</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L64v "Source")

If *translate* is specified, sets the projections translation offset to the specified two-element array [<i>t<sub>x</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>y</sub></i>] and returns the projection. If *translate* is not specified, returns the current translation offset which defaults to [480, 250]. The translation offset determines the pixel coordinates of the projections [center](#projection_center). The default translation offset places 0,0 at the center of a 960500 area.

<a href="#projection_center" name="projection_center">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>center</b>([<i>center</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L68 "Source")

If *center* is specified, sets the projections center to the specified *center*, a two-element array of longitude and latitude in degrees and returns the projection. If *center* is not specified, returns the current center, which defaults to 0,0.

<a href="#projection_rotate" name="projection_rotate">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>rotate</b>([<i>angles</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L72 "Source")

If *rotation* is specified, sets the projections [three-axis rotation](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4282586) to the specified *angles*, which must be a two- or three-element array of numbers [*lambda*, *phi*, *gamma*] specifying the rotation angles in degrees about [each spherical axis](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4282586). (These correspond to [yaw, pitch and roll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes).) If the rotation angle *gamma* is omitted, it defaults to 0. See also [d3.geoRotation](#geoRotation). If *rotation* is not specified, returns the current rotation which defaults [0, 0, 0].

<a href="#projection_precision" name="projection_precision">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>precision</b>([<i>precision</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L76 "Source")

If *precision* is specified, sets the threshold for the projections [adaptive resampling](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3795544) to the specified value in pixels and returns the projection. This value corresponds to the [DouglasPeucker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RamerDouglasPeucker_algorithm) distance. If *precision* is not specified, returns the projections current resampling precision which defaults to 0.5  0.70710

<a href="#projection_fitExtent" name="projection_fitExtent">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>fitExtent</b>(<i>extent</i>, <i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L80 "Source")

Sets the projections [scale](#projection_scale) and [translate](#projection_translate) to fit the specified GeoJSON *object* in the center of the given *extent*. The extent is specified as an array \[\[x, y\], \[x, y\]\], where x is the left side of the bounding box, y is the top, x is the right and y is the bottom. Returns the projection.

For example, to scale and translate the [New Jersey State Plane projection](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5126418) to fit a GeoJSON object *nj* in the center of a 960500 bounding box with 20 pixels of padding on each side:

```js
var projection = d3.geoTransverseMercator()
    .rotate([74 + 30 / 60, -38 - 50 / 60])
    .fitExtent([[20, 20], [940, 480]], nj);
```

Any [clip extent](#projection_clipExtent) is ignored when determining the new scale and translate. The [precision](#projection_precision) used to compute the bounding box of the given *object* is computed at an effective scale of 150.

<a href="#projection_fitSize" name="projection_fitSize">#</a> <i>projection</i>.<b>fitSize</b>(<i>size</i>, <i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L82 "Source")

A convenience method for [*projection*.fitExtent](#projection_fitExtent) where the top-left corner of the extent is [0, 0]. The following two statements are equivalent:

```js
projection.fitExtent([[0, 0], [width, height]], object);
projection.fitSize([width, height], object);
```

#### Azimuthal Projections

Azimuthal projections project the sphere directly onto a plane.

The stereographic projection.

#### Composite Projections

Composite consist of several projections that are composed into a single display. The constituent projections have fixed clip, center and rotation, and thus composite projections do not support [*projection*.center](#projection_center), [*projection*.rotate](#projection_rotate), [*projection*.clipAngle](#projection_clipAngle), or [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent).

<a href="#geoAlbersUsa" name="geoAlbersUsa">#</a> d3.<b>geoAlbersUsa</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/albersUsa.js "Source")

This is a U.S.-centric composite projection of three [d3.geoConicEqualArea](#geoConicEqualArea) projections: [d3.geoAlbers](#geoAlbers) is used for the lower forty-eight states, and separate conic equal-area projections are used for Alaska and Hawaii. Note that the scale for Alaska is diminished: it is projected at 0.35 its true relative area. This diagram by Philippe Rivire illustrates how this projection uses two rectangular insets for Alaska and Hawaii:

See [d3-composite-projections](http://geoexamples.com/d3-composite-projections/) for more examples.

#### Conic Projections

Conic projections project the sphere onto a cone, and then unroll the cone onto the plane. Conic projections have [two standard parallels](#conic_parallels).

<a href="#conic_parallels" name="conic_parallels">#</a> <i>conic</i>.<b>parallels</b>([<i>parallels</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/conic.js#L10 "Source")

#### Cylindrical Projections

Cylindrical projections project the sphere onto a containing cylinder, and then unroll the cylinder onto the plane.

<a href="#geoEquirectangular" name="geoEquirectangular">#</a> d3.<b>geoEquirectangular</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/equirectangular.js "Source")

The transverse spherical Mercator projection. Defines a default [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent) such that the world is projected to a square, clipped to approximately 85 latitude.

### Raw Projections

Raw projections are point transformation functions that are used to implement custom projections; they typically passed to [d3.geoProjection](#geoProjection) or [d3.geoProjectionMutator](#geoProjectionMutator). They are exposed here to facilitate the derivation of related projections. Raw projections take spherical coordinates \[*lambda*, *phi*\] in radians (not degrees!) and return a point \[*x*, *y*\], typically in the unit square centered around the origin.

<a href="#_project" name="_project">#</a> <i>project</i>(<i>lambda</i>, <i>phi</i>)

Projects the specified point [<i>lambda</i>, <i>phi</i>] in radians, returning a new point \[*x*, *y*\] in unitless coordinates.

<a href="#project_invert" name="project_invert">#</a> <i>project</i>.<b>invert</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)

The inverse of [*project*](#_project).

<a href="#geoProjection" name="geoProjection">#</a> d3.<b>geoProjection</b>(<i>project</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L18 "Source")

Constructs a new projection from the specified [raw projection](#_project), *project*. The *project* function takes the *longitude* and *latitude* of a given point in [radians](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radian.html), often referred to as *lambda* () and *phi* (), and returns a two-element array \[*x*, *y*\] representing its unit projection. The *project* function does not need to scale or translate the point, as these are applied automatically by [*projection*.scale](#projection_scale), [*projection*.translate](#projection_translate), and [*projection*.center](#projection_center). Likewise, the *project* function does not need to perform any spherical rotation, as [*projection*.rotate](#projection_rotate) is applied prior to projection.

For example, a spherical Mercator projection can be implemented as:

```js
var mercator = d3.geoProjection(function(x, y) {
  return [x, Math.log(Math.tan(Math.PI / 4 + y / 2))];
});
```

If the *project* function exposes an *invert* method, the returned projection will also expose [*projection*.invert](#projection_invert).

<a href="#geoProjectionMutator" name="geoProjectionMutator">#</a> d3.<b>geoProjectionMutator</b>(<i>factory</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/index.js#L22 "Source")

Constructs a new projection from the specified [raw projection](#_project) *factory* and returns a *mutate* function to call whenever the raw projection changes. The *factory* must return a raw projection. The returned *mutate* function returns the wrapped projection. For example, a conic projection typically has two configurable parallels. A suitable *factory* function, such as [d3.geoConicEqualAreaRaw](#geoConicEqualAreaRaw), would have the form:

```js
// y0 and y1 represent two parallels
function conicFactory(phi0, phi1) {
  return function conicRaw(lambda, phi) {
    return [, ];
  };
}
```

Using d3.geoProjectionMutator, you can implement a standard projection that allows the parallels to be changed, reassigning the raw projection used internally by [d3.geoProjection](#geoProjection):

```js
function conicCustom() {
  var phi0 = 29.5,
      phi1 = 45.5,
      mutate = d3.geoProjectionMutator(conicFactory),
      projection = mutate(phi0, phi1);

  projection.parallels = function(_) {
    return arguments.length ? mutate(phi0 = +_[0], phi1 = +_[1]) : [phi0, phi1];
  };

  return projection;
}
```

When creating a mutable projection, the *mutate* function is typically not exposed.

### Spherical Math

<a name="geoArea" href="#geoArea">#</a> d3.<b>geoArea</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/area.js "Source")

Returns the spherical area of the specified GeoJSON *object* in [steradians](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Steradian.html). This is the spherical equivalent of [*path*.area](#path_area).

<a name="geoBounds" href="#geoBounds">#</a> d3.<b>geoBounds</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/bounds.js "Source")

Returns the [spherical bounding box](https://www.jasondavies.com/maps/bounds/) for the specified GeoJSON *object*. The bounding box is represented by a two-dimensional array: \[\[*left*, *bottom*], \[*right*, *top*\]\], where *left* is the minimum longitude, *bottom* is the minimum latitude, *right* is maximum longitude, and *top* is the maximum latitude. All coordinates are given in degrees. (Note that in projected planar coordinates, the minimum latitude is typically the maximum *y*-value, and the maximum latitude is typically the minimum *y*-value.) This is the spherical equivalent of [*path*.bounds](#path_bounds).

<a name="geoCentroid" href="#geoCentroid">#</a> d3.<b>geoCentroid</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/centroid.js "Source")

Returns the spherical centroid of the specified GeoJSON *object*. This is the spherical equivalent of [*path*.centroid](#path_centroid).

<a name="geoDistance" href="#geoDistance">#</a> d3.<b>geoDistance</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/distance.js "Source")

Returns the great-arc distance in [radians](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radian.html) between the two points *a* and *b*. Each point must be specified as a two-element array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees. This is the spherical equivalent of [*path*.measure](#path_measure) given a LineString of two points.

<a name="geoLength" href="#geoLength">#</a> d3.<b>geoLength</b>(<i>object</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/length.js "Source")

Returns the great-arc length of the specified GeoJSON *object* in [radians](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radian.html). For polygons, returns the perimeter of the exterior ring plus that of any interior rings. This is the spherical equivalent of [*path*.measure](#path_measure).

<a name="geoInterpolate" href="#geoInterpolate">#</a> d3.<b>geoInterpolate</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/interpolate.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator function given two points *a* and *b*. Each point must be specified as a two-element array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees. The returned interpolator function takes a single argument *t*, where *t* is a number ranging from 0 to 1; a value of 0 returns the point *a*, while a value of 1 returns the point *b*. Intermediate values interpolate from *a* to *b* along the great arc that passes through both *a* and *b*. If *a* and *b* are antipodes, an arbitrary great arc is chosen.

<a name="geoContains" href="#geoContains">#</a> d3.<b>geoContains</b>(<i>object</i>, <i>point</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/contains.js "Source")

Returns true if and only if the specified GeoJSON *object* contains the specified *point*, or false if the *object* does not contain the *point*. The point must be specified as a two-element array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees. For Point and MultiPoint geometries, an exact test is used; for a Sphere, true is always returned; for other geometries, an epsilon threshold is applied.

<a name="geoRotation" href="#geoRotation">#</a> d3.<b>geoRotation</b>(<i>angles</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/rotation.js "Source")

Returns a [rotation function](#_rotation) for the given *angles*, which must be a two- or three-element array of numbers [*lambda*, *phi*, *gamma*] specifying the rotation angles in degrees about [each spherical axis](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4282586). (These correspond to [yaw, pitch and roll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes).) If the rotation angle *gamma* is omitted, it defaults to 0. See also [*projection*.rotate](#projection_rotate).

<a name="_rotation" href="#_rotation">#</a> <i>rotation</i>(<i>point</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/rotation.js#L35 "Source")

Returns a new array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees representing the rotated point of the given *point*. The point must be specified as a two-element array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees.

<a name="rotation_invert" href="#rotation_invert">#</a> <i>rotation</i>.<b>invert</b>(<i>point</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/rotation.js#L47 "Source")

Returns a new array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees representing the point of the given rotated *point*; the inverse of [*rotation*](#_rotation). The point must be specified as a two-element array \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees.

### Spherical Shapes

To generate a [great arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) (a segment of a great circle), simply pass a GeoJSON LineString geometry object to a [d3.geoPath](#geoPath). D3s projections use great-arc interpolation for intermediate points, so theres no need for a great arc shape generator.

<a name="geoCircle" href="#geoCircle">#</a> d3.<b>geoCircle</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/circle.js "Source")

Returns a new circle generator.

<a name="_circle" href="#_circle">#</a> <i>circle</i>(<i>arguments</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/circle.js#L47 "Source")

Returns a new GeoJSON geometry object of type Polygon approximating a circle on the surface of a sphere, with the current [center](#circle_center), [radius](#circle_radius) and [precision](#circle_precision). Any *arguments* are passed to the accessors.

<a name="circle_center" href="#circle_center">#</a> <i>circle</i>.<b>center</b>([<i>center</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/circle.js#L59 "Source")

If *center* is specified, sets the circle center to the specified point \[*longitude*, *latitude*\] in degrees, and returns this circle generator. The center may also be specified as a function; this function will be invoked whenever a circle is [generated](#_circle), being passed any arguments passed to the circle generator. If *center* is not specified, returns the current center accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function center() {
  return [0, 0];
}
```

<a name="circle_radius" href="#circle_radius">#</a> <i>circle</i>.<b>radius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/circle.js#L63 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the circle radius to the specified angle in degrees, and returns this circle generator. The radius may also be specified as a function; this function will be invoked whenever a circle is [generated](#_circle), being passed any arguments passed to the circle generator. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current radius accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function radius() {
  return 90;
}
```

<a name="circle_precision" href="#circle_precision">#</a> <i>circle</i>.<b>precision</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/circle.js#L67 "Source")

If *precision* is specified, sets the circle precision to the specified angle in degrees, and returns this circle generator. The precision may also be specified as a function; this function will be invoked whenever a circle is [generated](#_circle), being passed any arguments passed to the circle generator. If *precision* is not specified, returns the current precision accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function precision() {
  return 6;
}
```

Small circles do not follow great arcs and thus the generated polygon is only an approximation. Specifying a smaller precision angle improves the accuracy of the approximate polygon, but also increase the cost to generate and render it.

<a name="geoGraticule" href="#geoGraticule">#</a> d3.<b>geoGraticule</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/graticule.js "Source")

A convenience method for directly generating the default 10 global graticule as a GeoJSON MultiLineString geometry object. Equivalent to:

```js
function geoGraticule10() {
  return d3.geoGraticule()();
}
```

### Streams

D3 transforms geometry using a sequence of function calls, rather than materializing intermediate representations, to minimize overhead. Streams must implement several methods to receive input geometry. Streams are inherently stateful; the meaning of a [point](#point) depends on whether the point is inside of a [line](#lineStart), and likewise a line is distinguished from a ring by a [polygon](#polygonStart). Despite the name stream, these method calls are currently synchronous.

<a href="#geoStream" name="geoStream">#</a> d3.<b>geoStream</b>(<i>object</i>, <i>stream</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/stream.js "Source")

Streams the specified [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org) *object* to the specified [projection *stream*](#projection-streams). While both features and geometry objects are supported as input, the stream interface only describes the geometry, and thus additional feature properties are not visible to streams.

<a name="stream_point" href="#stream_point">#</a> <i>stream</i>.<b>point</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>[, <i>z</i>])

Indicates a point with the specified coordinates *x* and *y* (and optionally *z*). The coordinate system is unspecified and implementation-dependent; for example, [projection streams](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection) require spherical coordinates in degrees as input. Outside the context of a polygon or line, a point indicates a point geometry object ([Point](http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#point) or [MultiPoint](http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#multipoint)). Within a line or polygon ring, the point indicates a control point.

<a name="stream_lineStart" href="#stream_lineStart">#</a> <i>stream</i>.<b>lineStart</b>()

Indicates the start of a line or ring. Within a polygon, indicates the start of a ring. The first ring of a polygon is the exterior ring, and is typically clockwise. Any subsequent rings indicate holes in the polygon, and are typically counterclockwise.

<a name="stream_lineEnd" href="#stream_lineEnd">#</a> <i>stream</i>.<b>lineEnd</b>()

Indicates the end of a line or ring. Within a polygon, indicates the end of a ring. Unlike GeoJSON, the redundant closing coordinate of a ring is *not* indicated via [point](#point), and instead is implied via lineEnd within a polygon. Thus, the given polygon input:

```json
{
  "type": "Polygon",
  "coordinates": [
    [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0]]
  ]
}
```

Will produce the following series of method calls on the stream:

```js
stream.polygonStart();
stream.lineStart();
stream.point(0, 0);
stream.point(0, 1);
stream.point(1, 1);
stream.point(1, 0);
stream.lineEnd();
stream.polygonEnd();
```

<a name="stream_polygonStart" href="#stream_polygonStart">#</a> <i>stream</i>.<b>polygonStart</b>()

Indicates the start of a polygon. The first line of a polygon indicates the exterior ring, and any subsequent lines indicate interior holes.

<a name="stream_polygonEnd" href="#stream_polygonEnd">#</a> <i>stream</i>.<b>polygonEnd</b>()

Indicates the end of a polygon.

<a name="stream_sphere" href="#stream_sphere">#</a> <i>stream</i>.<b>sphere</b>()

Indicates the sphere (the globe; the unit sphere centered at 0,0,0).

### Transforms

Transforms are a generalization of projections. Transform implement [*projection*.stream](#projection_stream) and can be passed to [*path*.projection](#path_projection). However, they only implement a subset of the other projection methods, and represent arbitrary geometric transformations rather than projections from spherical to planar coordinates.

<a href="#geoTransform" name="geoTransform">#</a> d3.<b>geoTransform</b>(<i>methods</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/transform.js#L7 "Source")

Defines an arbitrary transform using the methods defined on the specified *methods* object. Any undefined methods will use pass-through methods that propagate inputs to the output stream. For example, to reflect the *y*-dimension (see also [*identity*.reflectY](#identity_reflectY)):

```js
var reflectY = d3.geoTransform({
  point: function(x, y) {
    this.stream.point(x, -y);
  }
});
```

Or to define an affine matrix transformation:

```js
function matrix(a, b, c, d, tx, ty) {
  return d3.geoTransform({
    point: function(x, y) {
      this.stream.point(a * x + b * y + tx, c * x + d * y + ty);
    }
  });
}
```

<a href="#geoIdentity" name="geoIdentity">#</a> d3.<b>geoIdentity</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/src/projection/identity.js "Source")

The identity transform can be used to scale, translate and clip planar geometry. It implements [*projection*.scale](#projection_scale), [*projection*.translate](#projection_translate), [*projection*.fitExtent](#projection_fitExtent), [*projection*.fitSize](#projection_fitSize) and [*projection*.clipExtent](#projection_clipExtent).

<a href="#identity_reflectX" name="identity_reflectX">#</a> <i>identity</i>.<b>reflectX</b>([<i>reflect</i>])

If *reflect* is specified, sets whether or not the *x*-dimension is reflected (negated) in the output. If *reflect* is not specified, returns true if *x*-reflection is enabled, which defaults to false.

<a href="#identity_reflectY" name="identity_reflectY">#</a> <i>identity</i>.<b>reflectY</b>([<i>reflect</i>])

If *reflect* is specified, sets whether or not the *y*-dimension is reflected (negated) in the output. If *reflect* is not specified, returns true if *y*-reflection is enabled, which defaults to false. This is especially useful for transforming from standard [spatial reference systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system), which treat positive *y* as pointing up, to display coordinate systems such as Canvas and SVG, which treat positive *y* as pointing down.

# d3-hierarchy

Many datasets are intrinsically hierarchical. Consider [geographic entities](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/hierarchy.html), such as census blocks, census tracts, counties and states; the command structure of businesses and governments; file systems and software packages. And even non-hierarchical data may be arranged empirically into a hierarchy, as with [*k*-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) or [phylogenetic trees](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c034d66572fd6bd6815a).

This module implements several popular techniques for visualizing hierarchical data:

**Node-link diagrams** show topology using discrete marks for nodes and links, such as a circle for each node and a line connecting each parent and child. The [tidy tree](#tree) is delightfully compact, while the [dendrogram](#cluster) places leaves at the same level. (These have both polar and Cartesian forms.) [Indented trees](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1093025) are useful for interactive browsing.

**Adjacency diagrams** show topology through the relative placement of nodes. They may also encode a quantitative dimension in the area of each node, for example to show revenue or file size. The [icicle diagram](#partition) uses rectangles, while the sunburst uses annular segments.

**Enclosure diagrams** also use an area encoding, but show topology through containment. A [treemap](#treemap) recursively subdivides area into rectangles. [Circle-packing](#pack) tightly nests circles; this is not as space-efficient as a treemap, but perhaps more readily shows topology.

A good hierarchical visualization facilitates rapid multiscale inference: micro-observations of individual elements and macro-observations of large groups.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-hierarchy`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-hierarchy.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

## API Reference

* [Hierarchy](#hierarchy) ([Stratify](#stratify))
* [Cluster](#cluster)
* [Tree](#tree)
* [Treemap](#treemap) ([Treemap Tiling](#treemap-tiling))
* [Partition](#partition)
* [Pack](#pack)

### Hierarchy

Before you can compute a hierarchical layout, you need a root node. If your data is already in a hierarchical format, such as JSON, you can pass it directly to [d3.hierarchy](#hierarchy); otherwise, you can rearrange tabular data, such as comma-separated values (CSV), into a hierarchy using [d3.stratify](#stratify).

<a name="hierarchy" href="#hierarchy">#</a> d3.<b>hierarchy</b>(<i>data</i>[, <i>children</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/index.js#L12 "Source")

Constructs a root node from the specified hierarchical *data*. The specified *data* must be an object representing the root node. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "Eve",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Cain"
    },
    {
      "name": "Seth",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "Enos"
        },
        {
          "name": "Noam"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Abel"
    },
    {
      "name": "Awan",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "Enoch"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Azura"
    }
  ]
}
```

The specified *children* accessor function is invoked for each datum, starting with the root *data*, and must return an array of data representing the children, or null if the current datum has no children. If *children* is not specified, it defaults to:

```js
function children(d) {
  return d.children;
}
```

The returned node and each descendant has the following properties:

* *node*.data - the associated data, as specified to the [constructor](#hierarchy).
* *node*.depth - zero for the root node, and increasing by one for each descendant generation.
* *node*.height - zero for leaf nodes, and the greatest distance from any descendant leaf for internal nodes.
* *node*.parent - the parent node, or null for the root node.
* *node*.children - an array of child nodes, if any; undefined for leaf nodes.
* *node*.value - the summed value of the node and its [descendants](#node_descendants); optional, see [*node*.sum](#node_sum) and [*node*.count](#node_count).

This method can also be used to test if a node is an `instanceof d3.hierarchy` and to extend the node prototype.

<a name="node_ancestors" href="#node_ancestors">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>ancestors</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/ancestors.js "Source")

Returns the array of ancestors nodes, starting with this node, then followed by each parent up to the root.

<a name="node_descendants" href="#node_descendants">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>descendants</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/descendants.js "Source")

Returns the array of descendant nodes, starting with this node, then followed by each child in topological order.

<a name="node_leaves" href="#node_leaves">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>leaves</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/leaves.js "Source")

Returns the array of leaf nodes in traversal order; leaves are nodes with no children.

<a name="node_path" href="#node_path">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>path</b>(<i>target</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/path.js "Source")

Returns the shortest path through the hierarchy from this *node* to the specified *target* node. The path starts at this *node*, ascends to the least common ancestor of this *node* and the *target* node, and then descends to the *target* node. This is particularly useful for [hierarchical edge bundling](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607999).

<a name="node_links" href="#node_links">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>links</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/links.js "Source")

Returns an array of links for this *node*, where each *link* is an object that defines source and target properties. The source of each link is the parent node, and the target is a child node.

<a name="node_sum" href="#node_sum">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>sum</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/sum.js "Source")

Evaluates the specified *value* function for this *node* and each descendant in [post-order traversal](#node_eachAfter), and returns this *node*. The *node*.value property of each node is set to the numeric value returned by the specified function plus the combined value of all descendants. The function is passed the nodes data, and must return a non-negative number. The *value* accessor is evaluated for *node* and every descendant, including internal nodes; if you only want leaf nodes to have internal value, then return zero for any node with children. [For example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b4c0f143db88a9eb01a315a1063c1d77), as an alternative to [*node*.count](#node_count):

```js
root.sum(function(d) { return d.value ? 1 : 0; });
```

You must call *node*.sum or [*node*.count](#node_count) before invoking a hierarchical layout that requires *node*.value, such as [d3.treemap](#treemap). Since the API supports [method chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining), you can invoke *node*.sum and [*node*.sort](#node_sort) before computing the layout, and then subsequently generate an array of all [descendant nodes](#node_descendants) like so:

```js
var treemap = d3.treemap()
    .size([width, height])
    .padding(2);

var nodes = treemap(root
    .sum(function(d) { return d.value; })
    .sort(function(a, b) { return b.height - a.height || b.value - a.value; }))
  .descendants();
```

This example assumes that the node data has a value field.

<a name="node_count" href="#node_count">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>count</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/count.js "Source")

Computes the number of leaves under this *node* and assigns it to *node*.value, and similarly for every descendant of *node*. If this *node* is a leaf, its count is one. Returns this *node*. See also [*node*.sum](#node_sum).

<a name="node_sort" href="#node_sort">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>sort</b>(<i>compare</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/sort.js "Source")

Sorts the children of this *node*, if any, and each of this *node*s descendants children, in [pre-order traversal](#node_eachBefore) using the specified *compare* function, and returns this *node*. The specified function is passed two nodes *a* and *b* to compare. If *a* should be before *b*, the function must return a value less than zero; if *b* should be before *a*, the function must return a value greater than zero; otherwise, the relative order of *a* and *b* are not specified. See [*array*.sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) for more.

Unlike [*node*.sum](#node_sum), the *compare* function is passed two [nodes](#hierarchy) rather than two nodes data. For example, if the data has a value property, this sorts nodes by the descending aggregate value of the node and all its descendants, as is recommended for [circle-packing](#pack):

```js
root
    .sum(function(d) { return d.value; })
    .sort(function(a, b) { return b.value - a.value; });
``````

Similarly, to sort nodes by descending height (greatest distance from any descendant leaf) and then descending value, as is recommended for [treemaps](#treemap) and [icicles](#partition):

```js
root
    .sum(function(d) { return d.value; })
    .sort(function(a, b) { return b.height - a.height || b.value - a.value; });
```

To sort nodes by descending height and then ascending id, as is recommended for [trees](#tree) and [dendrograms](#cluster):

```js
root
    .sum(function(d) { return d.value; })
    .sort(function(a, b) { return b.height - a.height || a.id.localeCompare(b.id); });
```

You must call *node*.sort before invoking a hierarchical layout if you want the new sort order to affect the layout; see [*node*.sum](#node_sum) for an example.

<a name="node_each" href="#node_each">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>each</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/each.js "Source")

Invokes the specified *function* for *node* and each descendant in [breadth-first order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), such that a given *node* is only visited if all nodes of lesser depth have already been visited, as well as all preceeding nodes of the same depth. The specified function is passed the current *node*.

<a name="node_eachAfter" href="#node_eachAfter">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>eachAfter</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/eachAfter.js "Source")

Invokes the specified *function* for *node* and each descendant in [post-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Post-order), such that a given *node* is only visited after all of its descendants have already been visited. The specified function is passed the current *node*.

<a name="node_eachBefore" href="#node_eachBefore">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>eachBefore</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/eachBefore.js "Source")

Invokes the specified *function* for *node* and each descendant in [pre-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order), such that a given *node* is only visited after all of its ancestors have already been visited. The specified function is passed the current *node*.

<a name="node_copy" href="#node_copy">#</a> <i>node</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/hierarchy/index.js#L39 "Source")

Return a deep copy of the subtree starting at this *node*. (The returned deep copy shares the same data, however.) The returned node is the root of a new tree; the returned nodes parent is always null and its depth is always zero.

#### Stratify

Consider the following table of relationships:

Name  | Parent
------|--------
Eve   |
Cain  | Eve
Seth  | Eve
Enos  | Seth
Noam  | Seth
Abel  | Eve
Awan  | Eve
Enoch | Awan
Azura | Eve

These names are conveniently unique, so we can unambiguously represent the hierarchy as a CSV file:

```
name,parent
Eve,
Cain,Eve
Seth,Eve
Enos,Seth
Noam,Seth
Abel,Eve
Awan,Eve
Enoch,Awan
Azura,Eve
```

To parse the CSV using [d3.csvParse](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv#csvParse):

```js
var table = d3.csvParse(text);
```

This returns:

```json
[
  {"name": "Eve",   "parent": ""},
  {"name": "Cain",  "parent": "Eve"},
  {"name": "Seth",  "parent": "Eve"},
  {"name": "Enos",  "parent": "Seth"},
  {"name": "Noam",  "parent": "Seth"},
  {"name": "Abel",  "parent": "Eve"},
  {"name": "Awan",  "parent": "Eve"},
  {"name": "Enoch", "parent": "Awan"},
  {"name": "Azura", "parent": "Eve"}
]
```

To convert to a hierarchy:

```js
var root = d3.stratify()
    .id(function(d) { return d.name; })
    .parentId(function(d) { return d.parent; })
    (table);
```

This returns:

[<img alt="Stratify" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/master/img/stratify.png">](https://tonicdev.com/mbostock/56fed33d8630b01300f72daa)

This hierarchy can now be passed to a hierarchical layout, such as [d3.tree](#_tree), for visualization.

<a name="stratify" href="#stratify">#</a> d3.<b>stratify</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/stratify.js "Source")

Constructs a new stratify operator with the default settings.

<a name="_stratify" href="#_stratify">#</a> <i>stratify</i>(<i>data</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/stratify.js#L20 "Source")

Generates a new hierarchy from the specified tabular *data*. Each node in the returned object has a shallow copy of the properties from the corresponding data object, excluding the following reserved properties: id, parentId, children.

<a name="stratify_id" href="#stratify_id">#</a> <i>stratify</i>.<b>id</b>([<i>id</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/stratify.js#L64 "Source")

If *id* is specified, sets the id accessor to the given function and returns this stratify operator. Otherwise, returns the current id accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function id(d) {
  return d.id;
}
```

The id accessor is invoked for each element in the input data passed to the [stratify operator](#_stratify), being passed the current datum (*d*) and the current index (*i*). The returned string is then used to identify the nodes relationships in conjunction with the [parent id](#stratify_parentId). For leaf nodes, the id may be undefined; otherwise, the id must be unique. (Null and the empty string are equivalent to undefined.)

<a name="stratify_parentId" href="#stratify_parentId">#</a> <i>stratify</i>.<b>parentId</b>([<i>parentId</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/stratify.js#L68 "Source")

If *parentId* is specified, sets the parent id accessor to the given function and returns this stratify operator. Otherwise, returns the current parent id accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function parentId(d) {
  return d.parentId;
}
```

The parent id accessor is invoked for each element in the input data passed to the [stratify operator](#_stratify), being passed the current datum (*d*) and the current index (*i*). The returned string is then used to identify the nodes relationships in conjunction with the [id](#stratify_id). For the root node, the parent id should be undefined. (Null and the empty string are equivalent to undefined.) There must be exactly one root node in the input data, and no circular relationships.

### Cluster

[<img alt="Dendrogram" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/master/img/cluster.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ff91c1558bc570b08539547ccc90050b)

The **cluster layout** produces [dendrograms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram): node-link diagrams that place leaf nodes of the tree at the same depth. Dendograms are typically less compact than [tidy trees](#tree), but are useful when all the leaves should be at the same level, such as for hierarchical clustering or [phylogenetic tree diagrams](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c034d66572fd6bd6815a).

<a name="cluster" href="#cluster">#</a> d3.<b>cluster</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/cluster.js "Source")

Creates a new cluster layout with default settings.

<a name="_cluster" href="#_cluster">#</a> <i>cluster</i>(<i>root</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/cluster.js#L39 "Source")

Lays out the specified *root* [hierarchy](#hierarchy), assigning the following properties on *root* and its descendants:

* *node*.x - the *x*-coordinate of the node
* *node*.y - the *y*-coordinate of the node

The coordinates *x* and *y* represent an arbitrary coordinate system; for example, you can treat *x* as an angle and *y* as a radius to produce a [radial layout](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4739610f6d96aaad2fb1e78a72b385ab). You may want to call [*root*.sort](#node_sort) before passing the hierarchy to the cluster layout.

<a name="cluster_size" href="#cluster_size">#</a> <i>cluster</i>.<b>size</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/cluster.js#L75 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets this cluster layouts size to the specified two-element array of numbers [*width*, *height*] and returns this cluster layout. If *size* is not specified, returns the current layout size, which defaults to [1, 1]. A layout size of null indicates that a [node size](#node_size) will be used instead. The coordinates *x* and *y* represent an arbitrary coordinate system; for example, to produce a [radial layout](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4739610f6d96aaad2fb1e78a72b385ab), a size of [360, *radius*] corresponds to a breadth of 360 and a depth of *radius*.

<a name="cluster_nodeSize" href="#cluster_nodeSize">#</a> <i>cluster</i>.<b>nodeSize</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/cluster.js#L79 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets this cluster layouts node size to the specified two-element array of numbers [*width*, *height*] and returns this cluster layout. If *size* is not specified, returns the current node size, which defaults to null. A node size of null indicates that a [layout size](#cluster_size) will be used instead. When a node size is specified, the root node is always positioned at 0, 0.

<a name="cluster_separation" href="#cluster_separation">#</a> <i>cluster</i>.<b>separation</b>([<i>separation</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/cluster.js#L71 "Source")

If *separation* is specified, sets the separation accessor to the specified function and returns this cluster layout. If *separation* is not specified, returns the current separation accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function separation(a, b) {
  return a.parent == b.parent ? 1 : 2;
}
```

The separation accessor is used to separate neighboring leaves. The separation function is passed two leaves *a* and *b*, and must return the desired separation. The nodes are typically siblings, though the nodes may be more distantly related if the layout decides to place such nodes adjacent.

### Tree

[<img alt="Tidy Tree" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/master/img/tree.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9d0899acb5d3b8d839d9d613a9e1fe04)

The **tree** layout produces tidy node-link diagrams of trees using the [ReingoldTilford tidy algorithm](http://emr.cs.iit.edu/~reingold/tidier-drawings.pdf), improved to run in linear time by [Buchheim *et al.*](http://dirk.jivas.de/papers/buchheim02improving.pdf) Tidy trees are typically more compact than [dendograms](#cluster).

<a name="tree" href="#tree">#</a> d3.<b>tree</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/tree.js "Source")

Creates a new tree layout with default settings.

<a name="_tree" href="#_tree">#</a> <i>tree</i>(<i>root</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/tree.js#L106 "Source")

Lays out the specified *root* [hierarchy](#hierarchy), assigning the following properties on *root* and its descendants:

* *node*.x - the *x*-coordinate of the node
* *node*.y - the *y*-coordinate of the node

The coordinates *x* and *y* represent an arbitrary coordinate system; for example, you can treat *x* as an angle and *y* as a radius to produce a [radial layout](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2e12b0bd732e7fe4000e2d11ecab0268). You may want to call [*root*.sort](#node_sort) before passing the hierarchy to the tree layout.

<a name="tree_size" href="#tree_size">#</a> <i>tree</i>.<b>size</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/tree.js#L228 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets this tree layouts size to the specified two-element array of numbers [*width*, *height*] and returns this tree layout. If *size* is not specified, returns the current layout size, which defaults to [1, 1]. A layout size of null indicates that a [node size](#node_size) will be used instead. The coordinates *x* and *y* represent an arbitrary coordinate system; for example, to produce a [radial layout](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2e12b0bd732e7fe4000e2d11ecab0268), a size of [360, *radius*] corresponds to a breadth of 360 and a depth of *radius*.

<a name="tree_nodeSize" href="#tree_nodeSize">#</a> <i>tree</i>.<b>nodeSize</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/tree.js#L232 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets this tree layouts node size to the specified two-element array of numbers [*width*, *height*] and returns this tree layout. If *size* is not specified, returns the current node size, which defaults to null. A node size of null indicates that a [layout size](#tree_size) will be used instead. When a node size is specified, the root node is always positioned at 0, 0.

<a name="tree_separation" href="#tree_separation">#</a> <i>tree</i>.<b>separation</b>([<i>separation</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/tree.js#L224 "Source")

If *separation* is specified, sets the separation accessor to the specified function and returns this tree layout. If *separation* is not specified, returns the current separation accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function separation(a, b) {
  return a.parent == b.parent ? 1 : 2;
}
```

A variation that is more appropriate for radial layouts reduces the separation gap proportionally to the radius:

```js
function separation(a, b) {
  return (a.parent == b.parent ? 1 : 2) / a.depth;
}
```

The separation accessor is used to separate neighboring nodes. The separation function is passed two nodes *a* and *b*, and must return the desired separation. The nodes are typically siblings, though the nodes may be more distantly related if the layout decides to place such nodes adjacent.

### Treemap

[<img alt="Treemap" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/master/img/treemap.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6bbb0a7ff7686b124d80)

Introduced by [Ben Shneiderman](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/) in 1991, a **treemap** recursively subdivides area into rectangles according to each nodes associated value. D3s treemap implementation supports an extensible [tiling method](#treemap_tile): the default [squarified](#treemapSquarify) method seeks to generate rectangles with a [golden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) aspect ratio; this offers better readability and size estimation than [slice-and-dice](#treemapSliceDice), which simply alternates between horizontal and vertical subdivision by depth.

<a name="treemap" href="#treemap">#</a> d3.<b>treemap</b>()

Creates a new treemap layout with default settings.

<a name="_treemap" href="#_treemap">#</a> <i>treemap</i>(<i>root</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L18 "Source")

Lays out the specified *root* [hierarchy](#hierarchy), assigning the following properties on *root* and its descendants:

* *node*.x0 - the left edge of the rectangle
* *node*.y0 - the top edge of the rectangle
* *node*.x1 - the right edge of the rectangle
* *node*.y1 - the bottom edge of the rectangle

You must call [*root*.sum](#node_sum) before passing the hierarchy to the treemap layout. You probably also want to call [*root*.sort](#node_sort) to order the hierarchy before computing the layout.

<a name="treemap_tile" href="#treemap_tile">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>tile</b>([<i>tile</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L61 "Source")

If *tile* is specified, sets the [tiling method](#treemap-tiling) to the specified function and returns this treemap layout. If *tile* is not specified, returns the current tiling method, which defaults to [d3.treemapSquarify](#treemapSquarify) with the golden ratio.

<a name="treemap_size" href="#treemap_size">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>size</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L57 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets this treemap layouts size to the specified two-element array of numbers [*width*, *height*] and returns this treemap layout. If *size* is not specified, returns the current size, which defaults to [1, 1].

<a name="treemap_round" href="#treemap_round">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>round</b>([<i>round</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L53 "Source")

If *round* is specified, enables or disables rounding according to the given boolean and returns this treemap layout. If *round* is not specified, returns the current rounding state, which defaults to false.

<a name="treemap_padding" href="#treemap_padding">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>padding</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L65 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the [inner](#treemap_paddingInner) and [outer](#treemap_paddingOuter) padding to the specified number or function and returns this treemap layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current inner padding function.

<a name="treemap_paddingInner" href="#treemap_paddingInner">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>paddingInner</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L69 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the inner padding to the specified number or function and returns this treemap layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current inner padding function, which defaults to the constant zero. If *padding* is a function, it is invoked for each node with children, being passed the current node. The inner padding is used to separate a nodes adjacent children.

<a name="treemap_paddingOuter" href="#treemap_paddingOuter">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>paddingOuter</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L73 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the [top](#treemap_paddingTop), [right](#treemap_paddingRight), [bottom](#treemap_paddingBottom) and [left](#treemap_paddingLeft) padding to the specified number or function and returns this treemap layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current top padding function.

<a name="treemap_paddingTop" href="#treemap_paddingTop">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>paddingTop</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L77 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the top padding to the specified number or function and returns this treemap layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current top padding function, which defaults to the constant zero. If *padding* is a function, it is invoked for each node with children, being passed the current node. The top padding is used to separate the top edge of a node from its children.

<a name="treemap_paddingRight" href="#treemap_paddingRight">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>paddingRight</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L81 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the right padding to the specified number or function and returns this treemap layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current right padding function, which defaults to the constant zero. If *padding* is a function, it is invoked for each node with children, being passed the current node. The right padding is used to separate the right edge of a node from its children.

<a name="treemap_paddingBottom" href="#treemap_paddingBottom">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>paddingBottom</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L85 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the bottom padding to the specified number or function and returns this treemap layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current bottom padding function, which defaults to the constant zero. If *padding* is a function, it is invoked for each node with children, being passed the current node. The bottom padding is used to separate the bottom edge of a node from its children.

<a name="treemap_paddingLeft" href="#treemap_paddingLeft">#</a> <i>treemap</i>.<b>paddingLeft</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/index.js#L89 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the left padding to the specified number or function and returns this treemap layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current left padding function, which defaults to the constant zero. If *padding* is a function, it is invoked for each node with children, being passed the current node. The left padding is used to separate the left edge of a node from its children.

#### Treemap Tiling

Several built-in tiling methods are provided for use with [*treemap*.tile](#treemap_tile).

<a name="treemapBinary" href="#treemapBinary">#</a> d3.<b>treemapBinary</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>x0</i>, <i>y0</i>, <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/binary.js "Source")

Recursively partitions the specified *nodes* into an approximately-balanced binary tree, choosing horizontal partitioning for wide rectangles and vertical partitioning for tall rectangles.

<a name="treemapDice" href="#treemapDice">#</a> d3.<b>treemapDice</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>x0</i>, <i>y0</i>, <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/dice.js "Source")

Divides the rectangular area specified by *x0*, *y0*, *x1*, *y1* horizontally according the value of each of the specified *node*s children. The children are positioned in order, starting with the left edge (*x0*) of the given rectangle. If the sum of the childrens values is less than the specified *node*s value (*i.e.*, if the specified *node* has a non-zero internal value), the remaining empty space will be positioned on the right edge (*x1*) of the given rectangle.

<a name="treemapSlice" href="#treemapSlice">#</a> d3.<b>treemapSlice</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>x0</i>, <i>y0</i>, <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/slice.js "Source")

Divides the rectangular area specified by *x0*, *y0*, *x1*, *y1* vertically according the value of each of the specified *node*s children. The children are positioned in order, starting with the top edge (*y0*) of the given rectangle. If the sum of the childrens values is less than the specified *node*s value (*i.e.*, if the specified *node* has a non-zero internal value), the remaining empty space will be positioned on the bottom edge (*y1*) of the given rectangle.

<a name="treemapSliceDice" href="#treemapSliceDice">#</a> d3.<b>treemapSliceDice</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>x0</i>, <i>y0</i>, <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/sliceDice.js "Source")

If the specified *node* has odd depth, delegates to [treemapSlice](#treemapSlice); otherwise delegates to [treemapDice](#treemapDice).

<a name="treemapSquarify" href="#treemapSquarify">#</a> d3.<b>treemapSquarify</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>x0</i>, <i>y0</i>, <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/squarify.js "Source")

Implements the [squarified treemap](https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf) algorithm by Bruls *et al.*, which seeks to produce rectangles of a given [aspect ratio](#squarify_ratio).

<a name="treemapResquarify" href="#treemapResquarify">#</a> d3.<b>treemapResquarify</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>x0</i>, <i>y0</i>, <i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/resquarify.js "Source")

Like [d3.treemapSquarify](#treemapSquarify), except preserves the topology (node adjacencies) of the previous layout computed by d3.treemapResquarify, if there is one and it used the same [target aspect ratio](#resquarify_ratio). This tiling method is good for animating changes to treemaps because it only changes node sizes and not their relative positions, thus avoiding distracting shuffling and occlusion. The downside of a stable update, however, is a suboptimal layout for subsequent updates: only the first layout uses the Bruls *et al.* squarified algorithm.

<a name="squarify_ratio" href="#squarify_ratio">#</a> <i>squarify</i>.<b>ratio</b>(<i>ratio</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/treemap/squarify.js#L58 "Source")

Specifies the desired aspect ratio of the generated rectangles. The *ratio* must be specified as a number greater than or equal to one. Note that the orientation of the generated rectangles (tall or wide) is not implied by the ratio; for example, a ratio of two will attempt to produce a mixture of rectangles whose *width*:*height* ratio is either 2:1 or 1:2. (However, you can approximately achieve this result by generating a square treemap at different dimensions, and then [stretching the treemap](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5c50a377e76a1974248bd628befdec95) to the desired aspect ratio.) Furthermore, the specified *ratio* is merely a hint to the tiling algorithm; the rectangles are not guaranteed to have the specified aspect ratio. If not specified, the aspect ratio defaults to the golden ratio,  = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2, per [Kong *et al.*](http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/perception-treemaps)

### Partition

[<img alt="Partition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/master/img/partition.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2e73ec84221cb9773f4c)

The **partition layout** produces adjacency diagrams: a space-filling variant of a node-link tree diagram. Rather than drawing a link between parent and child in the hierarchy, nodes are drawn as solid areas (either arcs or rectangles), and their placement relative to other nodes reveals their position in the hierarchy. The size of the nodes encodes a quantitative dimension that would be difficult to show in a node-link diagram.

<a name="partition" href="#partition">#</a> d3.<b>partition</b>()

Creates a new partition layout with the default settings.

<a name="_partition" href="#_partition">#</a> <i>partition</i>(<i>root</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/partition.js#L10 "Source")

Lays out the specified *root* [hierarchy](#hierarchy), assigning the following properties on *root* and its descendants:

* *node*.x0 - the left edge of the rectangle
* *node*.y0 - the top edge of the rectangle
* *node*.x1 - the right edge of the rectangle
* *node*.y1 - the bottom edge of the rectangle

You must call [*root*.sum](#node_sum) before passing the hierarchy to the partition layout. You probably also want to call [*root*.sort](#node_sort) to order the hierarchy before computing the layout.

<a name="partition_size" href="#partition_size">#</a> <i>partition</i>.<b>size</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/partition.js#L43 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets this partition layouts size to the specified two-element array of numbers [*width*, *height*] and returns this partition layout. If *size* is not specified, returns the current size, which defaults to [1, 1].

<a name="partition_round" href="#partition_round">#</a> <i>partition</i>.<b>round</b>([<i>round</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/partition.js#L39 "Source")

If *round* is specified, enables or disables rounding according to the given boolean and returns this partition layout. If *round* is not specified, returns the current rounding state, which defaults to false.

<a name="partition_padding" href="#partition_padding">#</a> <i>partition</i>.<b>padding</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/partition.js#L47 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the padding to the specified number and returns this partition layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current padding, which defaults to zero. The padding is used to separate a nodes adjacent children.

### Pack

[<img alt="Circle-Packing" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/master/img/pack.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ca5b03a33affa4160321)

Enclosure diagrams use containment (nesting) to represent a hierarchy. The size of the leaf circles encodes a quantitative dimension of the data. The enclosing circles show the approximate cumulative size of each subtree, but due to wasted space there is some distortion; only the leaf nodes can be compared accurately. Although [circle packing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing) does not use space as efficiently as a [treemap](#treemap), the wasted space more prominently reveals the hierarchical structure.

<a name="pack" href="#pack">#</a> d3.<b>pack</b>()

Creates a new pack layout with the default settings.

<a name="_pack" href="#_pack">#</a> <i>pack</i>(<i>root</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/pack/index.js#L15 "Source")

Lays out the specified *root* [hierarchy](#hierarchy), assigning the following properties on *root* and its descendants:

* *node*.x - the *x*-coordinate of the circles center
* *node*.y - the *y*-coordinate of the circles center
* *node*.r - the radius of the circle

You must call [*root*.sum](#node_sum) before passing the hierarchy to the pack layout. You probably also want to call [*root*.sort](#node_sort) to order the hierarchy before computing the layout.

<a name="pack_radius" href="#pack_radius">#</a> <i>pack</i>.<b>radius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/pack/index.js#L30 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the pack layouts radius accessor to the specified function and returns this pack layout. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current radius accessor, which defaults to null. If the radius accessor is null, the radius of each leaf circle is derived from the leaf *node*.value (computed by [*node*.sum](#node_sum)); the radii are then scaled proportionally to fit the [layout size](#pack_size). If the radius accessor is not null, the radius of each leaf circle is specified exactly by the function.

<a name="pack_size" href="#pack_size">#</a> <i>pack</i>.<b>size</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/pack/index.js#L34 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets this pack layouts size to the specified two-element array of numbers [*width*, *height*] and returns this pack layout. If *size* is not specified, returns the current size, which defaults to [1, 1].

<a name="pack_padding" href="#pack_padding">#</a> <i>pack</i>.<b>padding</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/pack/index.js#L38 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets this pack layouts padding accessor to the specified number or function or returns this pack layout. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current padding accessor, which defaults to the constant zero. When siblings are packed, tangent siblings will be separated by approximately the specified padding; the enclosing parent circle will also be separated from its children by approximately the specified padding. If an [explicit radius](#pack_radius) is not specified, the padding is approximate because a two-pass algorithm is needed to fit within the [layout size](#pack_size): the circles are first packed without padding; a scaling factor is computed and applied to the specified padding; and lastly the circles are re-packed with padding.

<a name="packSiblings" href="#packSiblings">#</a> d3.<b>packSiblings</b>(<i>circles</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/pack/siblings.js "Source")

Packs the specified array of *circles*, each of which must have a *circle*.r property specifying the circles radius. Assigns the following properties to each circle:

* *circle*.x - the *x*-coordinate of the circles center
* *circle*.y - the *y*-coordinate of the circles center

The circles are positioned according to the front-chain packing algorithm by [Wang *et al.*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1124851)

<a name="packEnclose" href="#packEnclose">#</a> d3.<b>packEnclose</b>(<i>circles</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/src/pack/enclose.js "Source")

Computes the [smallest circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest-circle_problem) that encloses the specified array of *circles*, each of which must have a *circle*.r property specifying the circles radius, and *circle*.x and *circle*.y properties specifying the circles center. The enclosing circle is computed using the [Matouek-Sharir-Welzl algorithm](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/emo/PublFiles/SubexLinProg_ALG16_96.pdf).

# d3-interpolate

This module provides a variety of interpolation methods for blending between two values. Values may be numbers, colors, strings, arrays, or even deeply-nested objects. For example:

```js
var i = d3.interpolateNumber(10, 20);
i(0.0); // 10
i(0.2); // 12
i(0.5); // 15
i(1.0); // 20
```

The returned function `i` is called an *interpolator*. Given a starting value *a* and an ending value *b*, it takes a parameter *t* in the domain [0, 1] and returns the corresponding interpolated value between *a* and *b*. An interpolator typically returns a value equivalent to *a* at *t* = 0 and a value equivalent to *b* at *t* = 1.

You can interpolate more than just numbers. To find the perceptual midpoint between steelblue and brown:

```js
d3.interpolateLab("steelblue", "brown")(0.5); // "rgb(142, 92, 109)"
```

Heres a more elaborate example demonstrating type inference used by [interpolate](#interpolate):

```js
var i = d3.interpolate({colors: ["red", "blue"]}, {colors: ["white", "black"]});
i(0.0); // {colors: ["rgb(255, 0, 0)", "rgb(0, 0, 255)"]}
i(0.5); // {colors: ["rgb(255, 128, 128)", "rgb(0, 0, 128)"]}
i(1.0); // {colors: ["rgb(255, 255, 255)", "rgb(0, 0, 0)"]}
```

Note that the generic value interpolator detects not only nested objects and arrays, but also color strings and numbers embedded in strings!

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-interpolate`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-interpolate.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-color.v1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-interpolate.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var interpolate = d3.interpolateRgb("steelblue", "brown");

</script>
```

## API Reference

<a name="interpolate" href="#interpolate">#</a> d3.<b>interpolate</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>)

Returns an interpolator between the two arbitrary values *a* and *b*. The interpolator implementation is based on the type of the end value *b*, using the following algorithm:

1. If *b* is null, undefined or a boolean, use the constant *b*.
2. If *b* is a number, use [interpolateNumber](#interpolateNumber).
3. If *b* is a [color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#color) or a string coercible to a color, use [interpolateRgb](#interpolateRgb).
4. If *b* is a [date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), use [interpolateDate](#interpolateDate).
5. If *b* is a string, use [interpolateString](#interpolateString).
6. If *b* is an [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray), use [interpolateArray](#interpolateArray).
7. If *b* is coercible to a number, use [interpolateNumber](#interpolateNumber).
8. Use [interpolateObject](#interpolateObject).

Based on the chosen interpolator, *a* is coerced to the suitable corresponding type.

<a name="interpolateNumber" href="#interpolateNumber">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateNumber</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/number.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two numbers *a* and *b*. The returned interpolator is equivalent to:

```js
function interpolator(t) {
  return a * (1 - t) + b * t;
}
```

Caution: avoid interpolating to or from the number zero when the interpolator is used to generate a string. When very small values are stringified, they may be converted to scientific notation, which is an invalid attribute or style property value in older browsers. For example, the number `0.0000001` is converted to the string `"1e-7"`. This is particularly noticeable with interpolating opacity. To avoid scientific notation, start or end the transition at 1e-6: the smallest value that is not stringified in scientific notation.

<a name="interpolateRound" href="#interpolateRound">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateRound</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/round.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two numbers *a* and *b*; the interpolator is similar to [interpolateNumber](#interpolateNumber), except it will round the resulting value to the nearest integer.

<a name="interpolateString" href="#interpolateString">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateString</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/string.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two strings *a* and *b*. The string interpolator finds numbers embedded in *a* and *b*, where each number is of the form understood by JavaScript. A few examples of numbers that will be detected within a string: `-1`, `42`, `3.14159`, and `6.0221413e+23`.

For each number embedded in *b*, the interpolator will attempt to find a corresponding number in *a*. If a corresponding number is found, a numeric interpolator is created using [interpolateNumber](#interpolateNumber). The remaining parts of the string *b* are used as a template: the static parts of the string *b* remain constant for the interpolation, with the interpolated numeric values embedded in the template.

For example, if *a* is `"300 12px sans-serif"`, and *b* is `"500 36px Comic-Sans"`, two embedded numbers are found. The remaining static parts of the string are a space between the two numbers (`" "`), and the suffix (`"px Comic-Sans"`). The result of the interpolator at *t* = 0.5 is `"400 24px Comic-Sans"`.

<a name="interpolateDate" href="#interpolateDate">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateDate</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/date.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two [dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) *a* and *b*.

Note: **no defensive copy** of the returned date is created; the same Date instance is returned for every evaluation of the interpolator. No copy is made for performance reasons; interpolators are often part of the inner loop of [animated transitions](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).

<a name="interpolateArray" href="#interpolateArray">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateArray</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/array.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two arrays *a* and *b*. Internally, an array template is created that is the same length in *b*. For each element in *b*, if there exists a corresponding element in *a*, a generic interpolator is created for the two elements using [interpolate](#interpolate). If there is no such element, the static value from *b* is used in the template. Then, for the given parameter *t*, the templates embedded interpolators are evaluated. The updated array template is then returned.

For example, if *a* is the array `[0, 1]` and *b* is the array `[1, 10, 100]`, then the result of the interpolator for *t* = 0.5 is the array `[0.5, 5.5, 100]`.

Note: **no defensive copy** of the template array is created; modifications of the returned array may adversely affect subsequent evaluation of the interpolator. No copy is made for performance reasons; interpolators are often part of the inner loop of [animated transitions](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).

<a name="interpolateObject" href="#interpolateObject">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateObject</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/object.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two objects *a* and *b*. Internally, an object template is created that has the same properties as *b*. For each property in *b*, if there exists a corresponding property in *a*, a generic interpolator is created for the two elements using [interpolate](#interpolate). If there is no such property, the static value from *b* is used in the template. Then, for the given parameter *t*, the template's embedded interpolators are evaluated and the updated object template is then returned.

For example, if *a* is the object `{x: 0, y: 1}` and *b* is the object `{x: 1, y: 10, z: 100}`, the result of the interpolator for *t* = 0.5 is the object `{x: 0.5, y: 5.5, z: 100}`.

Object interpolation is particularly useful for *dataspace interpolation*, where data is interpolated rather than attribute values. For example, you can interpolate an object which describes an arc in a pie chart, and then use d3.svg.arc to compute the new SVG path data.

Note: **no defensive copy** of the template object is created; modifications of the returned object may adversely affect subsequent evaluation of the interpolator. No copy is made for performance reasons; interpolators are often part of the inner loop of [animated transitions](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).

<a name="interpolateTransformCss" href="#interpolateTransformCss">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateTransformCss</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/transform/index.js#L62 "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two 2D CSS transforms represented by *a* and *b*. Each transform is decomposed to a standard representation of translate, rotate, *x*-skew and scale; these component transformations are then interpolated. This behavior is standardized by CSS: see [matrix decomposition for animation](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/#matrix-decomposition).

<a name="interpolateTransformSvg" href="#interpolateTransformSvg">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateTransformSvg</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/transform/index.js#L63 "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two 2D SVG transforms represented by *a* and *b*. Each transform is decomposed to a standard representation of translate, rotate, *x*-skew and scale; these component transformations are then interpolated. This behavior is standardized by CSS: see [matrix decomposition for animation](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/#matrix-decomposition).

<a name="interpolateZoom" href="#interpolateZoom">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateZoom</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/zoom.js "Source")

Returns an interpolator between the two views *a* and *b* of a two-dimensional plane, based on [Smooth and efficient zooming and panning](http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/zoompan.pdf) by Jarke J. van Wijk and Wim A.A. Nuij. Each view is defined as an array of three numbers: *cx*, *cy* and *width*. The first two coordinates *cx*, *cy* represent the center of the viewport; the last coordinate *width* represents the size of the viewport.

The returned interpolator exposes a *duration* property which encodes the recommended transition duration in milliseconds. This duration is based on the path length of the curved trajectory through *x,y* space. If you want to a slower or faster transition, multiply this by an arbitrary scale factor (<i>V</i> as described in the original paper).

### Sampling

<a name="quantize" href="#quantize">#</a> d3.<b>quantize</b>(<i>interpolator</i>, <i>n</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/quantize.js "Source")

Returns *n* uniformly-spaced samples from the specified *interpolator*, where *n* is an integer greater than one. The first sample is always at *t* = 0, and the last sample is always at *t* = 1. This can be useful in generating a fixed number of samples from a given interpolator, such as to derive the range of a [quantize scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#quantize-scales) from a [continuous interpolator](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#interpolateWarm).

Caution: this method will not work with interpolators that do not return defensive copies of their output, such as [d3.interpolateArray](#interpolateArray), [d3.interpolateDate](#interpolateDate) and [d3.interpolateObject](#interpolateObject). For those interpolators, you must wrap the interpolator and create a copy for each returned value.

### Color Spaces

<a name="interpolateRgb" href="#interpolateRgb">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateRgb</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/rgb.js "Source")

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-interpolate/master/img/rgbGamma.png" width="100%" height="40" alt="rgbGamma">

Returns an RGB color space interpolator between the two colors *a* and *b* with a configurable [gamma](#interpolate_gamma). If the gamma is not specified, it defaults to 1.0. The colors *a* and *b* need not be in RGB; they will be converted to RGB using [d3.rgb](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#rgb). The return value of the interpolator is an RGB string.

<a href="#interpolateRgbBasis" name="interpolateRgbBasis">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateRgbBasis</b>(<i>colors</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/rgb.js#L54 "Source")

Returns a uniform nonrational B-spline interpolator through the specified array of *colors*, which are converted to [RGB color space](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#rgb). Implicit control points are generated such that the interpolator returns *colors*[0] at *t* = 0 and *colors*[*colors*.length - 1] at *t* = 1. Opacity interpolation is not currently supported. See also [d3.interpolateBasis](#interpolateBasis), and see [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic) for examples.

<a href="#interpolateRgbBasisClosed" name="interpolateRgbBasisClosed">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateRgbBasisClosed</b>(<i>colors</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/rgb.js#L55 "Source")

Returns a uniform nonrational B-spline interpolator through the specified array of *colors*, which are converted to [RGB color space](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#rgb). The control points are implicitly repeated such that the resulting spline has cyclical C continuity when repeated around *t* in [0,1]; this is useful, for example, to create cyclical color scales. Opacity interpolation is not currently supported. See also [d3.interpolateBasisClosed](#interpolateBasisClosed), and see [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic) for examples.

<a name="interpolateHsl" href="#interpolateHsl">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateHsl</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/hsl.js "Source")

The colors *a* and *b* need not be in HSL; they will be converted to HSL using [d3.hsl](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#hsl). If either colors hue or saturation is NaN, the opposing colors channel value is used. The shortest path between hues is used. The return value of the interpolator is an RGB string.

<a name="interpolateHslLong" href="#interpolateHslLong">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateHslLong</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/hsl.js#L21 "Source")

<a name="interpolateHcl" href="#interpolateHcl">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateHcl</b>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/hcl.js "Source")

For example, to interpolate from purple to orange with a gamma of 2.2 in RGB space:

```js
var interpolator = d3.interpolateRgb.gamma(2.2)("purple", "orange");

### Splines

Whereas standard interpolators blend from a starting value *a* at *t* = 0 to an ending value *b* at *t* = 1, spline interpolators smoothly blend multiple input values for *t* in [0,1] using piecewise polynomial functions. Only cubic uniform nonrational [B-splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) are currently supported, also known as basis splines.

<a href="#interpolateBasis" name="interpolateBasis">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateBasis</b>(<i>values</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/basis.js "Source")

Returns a uniform nonrational B-spline interpolator through the specified array of *values*, which must be numbers. Implicit control points are generated such that the interpolator returns *values*[0] at *t* = 0 and *values*[*values*.length - 1] at *t* = 1. See also [d3.curveBasis](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curveBasis).

<a href="#interpolateBasisClosed" name="interpolateBasisClosed">#</a> d3.<b>interpolateBasisClosed</b>(<i>values</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate/blob/master/src/basisClosed.js "Source")

Returns a uniform nonrational B-spline interpolator through the specified array of *values*, which must be numbers. The control points are implicitly repeated such that the resulting one-dimensional spline has cyclical C continuity when repeated around *t* in [0,1].

# d3-path

Say you have some code that draws to a 2D canvas:

```js
function drawCircle(context, radius) {
  context.moveTo(radius, 0);
  context.arc(0, 0, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
}
```

The d3-path module lets you take this exact code and additionally render to [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html). It works by [serializing](#path_toString) [CanvasPathMethods](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls to [SVG path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData). For example:

```js
var context = d3.path();
drawCircle(context, 40);
pathElement.setAttribute("d", context.toString());
```

Now code you write once can be used with both Canvas (for performance) and SVG (for convenience). For a practical example, see [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape).

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-path`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-path/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-path.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

# d3-polygon

This module provides a few basic geometric operations for two-dimensional polygons. Each polygon is represented as an array of two-element arrays [[<i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>], [<i>x2</i>, <i>y2</i>], ], and may either be closed (wherein the first and last point are the same) or open (wherein they are not). Typically polygons are in counterclockwise order, assuming a coordinate system where the origin 0,0 is in the top-left corner.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-polygon`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-polygon/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-polygon.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-polygon.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var hull = d3.polygonHull(points);

</script>
```

# d3-quadtree

A [quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) recursively partitions two-dimensional space into squares, dividing each square into four equally-sized squares. Each distinct point exists in a unique leaf [node](#nodes); coincident points are represented by a linked list. Quadtrees can accelerate various spatial operations, such as the [BarnesHut approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarnesHut_simulation) for computing many-body forces, collision detection, and searching for nearby points.

## API Reference

<a name="quadtree" href="#quadtree">#</a> d3.<b>quadtree</b>([<i>data</i>[, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>]])
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/quadtree.js#L14 "Source")

Creates a new, empty quadtree with an empty [extent](#quadtree_extent) and the default [*x*-](#quadtree_x) and [*y*-](#quadtree_y)accessors. If *data* is specified, [adds](#quadtree_addAll) the specified array of data to the quadtree. This is equivalent to:

```js
var tree = d3.quadtree()
    .addAll(data);
```

If *x* and *y* are also specified, sets the [*x*-](#quadtree_x) and [*y*-](#quadtree_y) accessors to the specified functions before adding the specified array of data to the quadtree, equivalent to:

```js
var tree = d3.quadtree()
    .x(x)
    .y(y)
    .addAll(data);
```

<a name="quadtree_x" href="#quadtree_x">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>x</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/x.js "Source")

If *x* is specified, sets the current *x*-coordinate accessor and returns the quadtree. If *x* is not specified, returns the current *x*-accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function x(d) {
  return d[0];
}
```

The *x*-acccessor is used to derive the *x*-coordinate of data when [adding](#quadtree_add) to and [removing](#quadtree_remove) from the tree. It is also used when [finding](#quadtree_find) to re-access the coordinates of data previously added to the tree; therefore, the *x*- and *y*-accessors must be consistent, returning the same value given the same input.

<a name="quadtree_y" href="#quadtree_y">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>y</b>([<i>y</i>])
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/y.js "Source")

If *y* is specified, sets the current *y*-coordinate accessor and returns the quadtree. If *y* is not specified, returns the current *y*-accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function y(d) {
  return d[1];
}
```

The *y*-acccessor is used to derive the *y*-coordinate of data when [adding](#quadtree_add) to and [removing](#quadtree_remove) from the tree. It is also used when [finding](#quadtree_find) to re-access the coordinates of data previously added to the tree; therefore, the *x*- and *y*-accessors must be consistent, returning the same value given the same input.

<a name="quadtree_extent" href="#quadtree_extent">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>extent</b>([*extent*])
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/extent.js "Source")

If *extent* is specified, expands the quadtree to [cover](#quadtree_cover) the specified points [[*x0*, *y0*], [*x1*, *y1*]] and returns the quadtree. If *extent* is not specified, returns the quadtrees current extent [[*x0*, *y0*], [*x1*, *y1*]], where *x0* and *y0* are the inclusive lower bounds and *x1* and *y1* are the inclusive upper bounds, or undefined if the quadtree has no extent. The extent may also be expanded by calling [*quadtree*.cover](#quadtree_cover) or [*quadtree*.add](#quadtree_add).

<a name="quadtree_cover" href="#quadtree_cover">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>cover</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/cover.js "Source")

Expands the quadtree to cover the specified point *x*,*y*, and returns the quadtree. If the quadtrees extent already covers the specified point, this method does nothing. If the quadtree has an extent, the extent is repeatedly doubled to cover the specified point, wrapping the [root](#quadtree_root) [node](#nodes) as necessary; if the quadtree is empty, the extent is initialized to the extent [[*x*, *y*], [*x*, *y*]]. (Rounding is necessary such that if the extent is later doubled, the boundaries of existing quadrants do not change due to floating point error.)

<a name="quadtree_add" href="#quadtree_add">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>add</b>(<i>datum</i>)
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/add.js "Source")

Adds the specified *datum* to the quadtree, deriving its coordinates *x*,*y* using the current [*x*-](#quadtree_x) and [*y*-](#quadtree_y)accessors, and returns the quadtree. If the new point is outside the current [extent](#quadtree_extent) of the quadtree, the quadtree is automatically expanded to [cover](#quadtree_cover) the new point.

<a name="quadtree_addAll" href="#quadtree_addAll">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>addAll</b>(<i>data</i>)
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/add.js#L50 "Source")

Adds the specified array of *data* to the quadtree, deriving each elements coordinates *x*,*y* using the current [*x*-](#quadtree_x) and [*y*-](#quadtree_y)accessors, and return this quadtree. This is approximately equivalent to calling [*quadtree*.add](#quadtree_add) repeatedly:

```js
for (var i = 0, n = data.length; i < n; ++i) {
  quadtree.add(data[i]);
}
```

However, this method results in a more compact quadtree because the extent of the *data* is computed first before adding the data.

<a name="quadtree_remove" href="#quadtree_remove">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>remove</b>(<i>datum</i>)
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/remove.js "Source")

Removes the specified *datum* to the quadtree, deriving its coordinates *x*,*y* using the current [*x*-](#quadtree_x) and [*y*-](#quadtree_y)accessors, and returns the quadtree. If the specified *datum* does not exist in this quadtree, this method does nothing.

<a name="quadtree_removeAll" href="#quadtree_removeAll">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>removeAll</b>(<i>data</i>)
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/remove.js#L59 "Source")



<a name="quadtree_copy" href="#quadtree_copy">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>copy</b>()

Returns a copy of the quadtree. All [nodes](#nodes) in the returned quadtree are identical copies of the corresponding node in the quadtree; however, any data in the quadtree is shared by reference and not copied.

<a name="quadtree_root" href="#quadtree_root">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>root</b>()
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/root.js "Source")

Returns the root [node](#nodes) of the quadtree.

<a name="quadtree_data" href="#quadtree_data">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>data</b>()
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/data.js "Source")

Returns an array of all data in the quadtree.

<a name="quadtree_size" href="#quadtree_size">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>size</b>()
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/size.js "Source")

Returns the total number of data in the quadtree.

<a name="quadtree_find" href="#quadtree_find">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>find</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>[, <i>radius</i>])
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/find.js "Source")

Returns the datum closest to the position *x*,*y* with the given search *radius*. If *radius* is not specified, it defaults to infinity. If there is no datum within the search area, returns undefined.

<a name="quadtree_visit" href="#quadtree_visit">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>visit</b>(<i>callback</i>)
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/visit.js "Source")

Visits each [node](#nodes) in the quadtree in pre-order traversal, invoking the specified *callback* with arguments *node*, *x0*, *y0*, *x1*, *y1* for each node, where *node* is the node being visited, *x0*, *y0* are the lower bounds of the node, and *x1*, *y1* are the upper bounds, and returns the quadtree. (Assuming that positive *x* is right and positive *y* is down, as is typically the case in Canvas and SVG, *x0*, *y0* is the top-left corner and *x1*, *y1* is the lower-right corner; however, the coordinate system is arbitrary, so more formally *x0* <= *x1* and *y0* <= *y1*.)

If the *callback* returns true for a given node, then the children of that node are not visited; otherwise, all child nodes are visited. This can be used to quickly visit only parts of the tree, for example when using the [BarnesHut approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarnesHut_simulation). Note, however, that child quadrants are always visited in sibling order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. In cases such as [search](#quadtree_find), visiting siblings in a specific order may be faster.

<a name="quadtree_visitAfter" href="#quadtree_visitAfter">#</a> <i>quadtree</i>.<b>visitAfter</b>(<i>callback</i>)
 [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree/blob/master/src/visitAfter.js "Source")

Visits each [node](#nodes) in the quadtree in post-order traversal, invoking the specified *callback* with arguments *node*, *x0*, *y0*, *x1*, *y1* for each node, where *node* is the node being visited, *x0*, *y0* are the lower bounds of the node, and *x1*, *y1* are the upper bounds, and returns the quadtree. (Assuming that positive *x* is right and positive *y* is down, as is typically the case in Canvas and SVG, *x0*, *y0* is the top-left corner and *x1*, *y1* is the lower-right corner; however, the coordinate system is arbitrary, so more formally *x0* <= *x1* and *y0* <= *y1*.) Returns *root*.

### Nodes

Internal nodes of the quadtree are represented as four-element arrays in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order:

* `0` - the top-left quadrant, if any.
* `1` - the top-right quadrant, if any.
* `2` - the bottom-left quadrant, if any.
* `3` - the bottom-right quadrant, if any.

A child quadrant may be undefined if it is empty.

Leaf nodes are represented as objects with the following properties:

* `data` - the data associated with this point, as passed to [*quadtree*.add](#quadtree_add).
* `next` - the next datum in this leaf, if any.

The `length` property may be used to distinguish leaf nodes from internal nodes: it is undefined for leaf nodes, and 4 for internal nodes. For example, to iterate over all data in a leaf node:

```js
if (!node.length) do console.log(node.data); while (node = node.next);
```

The points *x*- and *y*-coordinates **must not be modified** while the point is in the quadtree. To update a points position, [remove](#quadtree_remove) the point and then re-[add](#quadtree_add) it to the quadtree at the new position. Alternatively, you may discard the existing quadtree entirely and create a new one from scratch; this may be more efficient if many of the points have moved.

File: ./node_modules/d3-queue/README.md
# d3-queue

A **queue** evaluates zero or more *deferred* asynchronous tasks with configurable concurrency: you control how many tasks run at the same time. When all the tasks complete, or an error occurs, the queue passes the results to your *await* callback. This library is similar to [Async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async)s [parallel](https://github.com/caolan/async#paralleltasks-callback) (when *concurrency* is infinite), [series](https://github.com/caolan/async#seriestasks-callback) (when *concurrency* is 1), and [queue](https://github.com/caolan/async#queue), but features a much smaller footprint: as of release 2, d3-queue is about 700 bytes gzipped, compared to 4,300 for Async.

Each task is defined as a function that takes a callback as its last argument. For example, heres a task that says hello after a short delay:

```js
function delayedHello(callback) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
    callback(null);
  }, 250);
}
```

When a task completes, it must call the provided callback. The first argument to the callback should be null if the task is successful, or the error if the task failed. The optional second argument to the callback is the return value of the task. (To return multiple values from a single callback, wrap the results in an object or array.)

To run multiple tasks simultaneously, create a queue, *defer* your tasks, and then register an *await* callback to be called when all of the tasks complete (or an error occurs):

```js
var q = d3.queue();
q.defer(delayedHello);
q.defer(delayedHello);
q.await(function(error) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log("Goodbye!");
});
```

Of course, you can also use a `for` loop to defer many tasks:

```js
var q = d3.queue();

for (var i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
  q.defer(delayedHello);
}

q.awaitAll(function(error) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log("Goodbye!");
});
```

Tasks can take optional arguments. For example, heres how to configure the delay before hello and provide a name:

```js
function delayedHello(name, delay, callback) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    callback(null);
  }, delay);
}
```

Any additional arguments provided to [*queue*.defer](#queue_defer) are automatically passed along to the task function before the callback argument. You can also use method chaining for conciseness, avoiding the need for a local variable:

```js
d3.queue()
    .defer(delayedHello, "Alice", 250)
    .defer(delayedHello, "Bob", 500)
    .defer(delayedHello, "Carol", 750)
    .await(function(error) {
      if (error) throw error;
      console.log("Goodbye!");
    });
```

The [asynchronous callback pattern](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#callbacks) is very common in Node.js, so Queue works directly with many Node APIs. For example, to [stat two files](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_stat_path_callback) concurrently:

```js
d3.queue()
    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + "/../Makefile")
    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + "/../package.json")
    .await(function(error, file1, file2) {
      if (error) throw error;
      console.log(file1, file2);
    });
```

You can also make abortable tasks: these tasks return an object with an *abort* method which terminates the task. So, if a task calls [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout) on start, it can call [clearTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearTimeout) on abort. For example:

```js
function delayedHello(name, delay, callback) {
  var id = setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    callback(null);
  }, delay);
  return {
    abort: function() {
      clearTimeout(id);
    }
  };
}
```

When you call [*queue*.abort](#queue_abort), any in-progress tasks will be immediately aborted; in addition, any pending (not-yet-started) tasks will not be started. Note that you can also use *queue*.abort *without* abortable tasks, in which case pending tasks will be cancelled, though active tasks will continue to run. Conveniently, the [d3-request](https://github.com/d3/d3-request) library implements abort atop XMLHttpRequest. For example:

```js
var q = d3.queue()
    .defer(d3.request, "http://www.google.com:81")
    .defer(d3.request, "http://www.google.com:81")
    .defer(d3.request, "http://www.google.com:81")
    .awaitAll(function(error, results) {
      if (error) throw error;
      console.log(results);
    });
```

To abort these requests, call `q.abort()`.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-queue`. If you use Bower, `bower install d3-queue`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-queue.v3.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-queue.v3.min.js"></script>
<script>

var q = d3.queue();

</script>
```

[Try d3-queue in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-queue)

## API Reference

<a href="#queue" name="queue">#</a> d3.<b>queue</b>([<i>concurrency</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue/blob/master/src/queue.js "Source")

Constructs a new queue with the specified *concurrency*. If *concurrency* is not specified, the queue has infinite concurrency. Otherwise, *concurrency* is a positive integer. For example, if *concurrency* is 1, then all tasks will be run in series. If *concurrency* is 3, then at most three tasks will be allowed to proceed concurrently; this is useful, for example, when loading resources in a web browser.

<a href="#queue_defer" name="queue_defer">#</a> <i>queue</i>.<b>defer</b>(<i>task</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue/blob/master/src/queue.js#L20 "Source")

Adds the specified asynchronous *task* callback to the queue, with any optional *arguments*. The *task* is a function that will be called when the task should start. It is passed the specified optional *arguments* and an additional *callback* as the last argument; the callback must be invoked by the task when it finishes. The task must invoke the callback with two arguments: the *error*, if any, and the *result* of the task. To return multiple results from a single callback, wrap the results in an object or array.

For example, heres a task which computes the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything after a short delay:

```js
function simpleTask(callback) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    callback(null, {answer: 42});
  }, 250);
}
```

If the task calls back with an error, any tasks that were scheduled *but not yet started* will not run. For a serial queue (of *concurrency* 1), this means that a task will only run if all previous tasks succeed. For a queue with higher concurrency, only the first error that occurs is reported to the await callback, and tasks that were started before the error occurred will continue to run; note, however, that their results will not be reported to the await callback.

Tasks can only be deferred before [*queue*.await](#queue_await) or [*queue*.awaitAll](#queue_awaitAll) is called. If a task is deferred after then, an error is thrown. If the *task* is not a function, an error is thrown.

<a href="#queue_abort" name="queue_abort">#</a> <i>queue</i>.<b>abort</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue/blob/master/src/queue.js#L29 "Source")

Aborts any active tasks, invoking each active tasks *task*.abort function, if any. Also prevents any new tasks from starting, and immediately invokes the [*queue*.await](#queue_await) or [*queue*.awaitAll](#queue_awaitAll) callback with an error indicating that the queue was aborted. See the [introduction](#d3-queue) for an example implementation of an abortable task. Note that if your tasks are not abortable, any running tasks will continue to run, even after the await callback has been invoked with the abort error. The await callback is invoked exactly once on abort, and so is not called when any running tasks subsequently succeed or fail.

<a href="#queue_await" name="queue_await">#</a> <i>queue</i>.<b>await</b>(<i>callback</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue/blob/master/src/queue.js#L33 "Source")

Sets the *callback* to be invoked when all deferred tasks have finished. The first argument to the *callback* is the first error that occurred, or null if no error occurred. If an error occurred, there are no additional arguments to the callback. Otherwise, the *callback* is passed each result as an additional argument. For example:

```js
d3.queue()
    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + "/../Makefile")
    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + "/../package.json")
    .await(function(error, file1, file2) { console.log(file1, file2); });
```

If all [deferred](#queue_defer) tasks have already completed, the callback will be invoked immediately. This method may only be called once, after any tasks have been deferred. If this method is called multiple times, or if it is called after [*queue*.awaitAll](#queue_awaitAll), an error is thrown. If the *callback* is not a function, an error is thrown.

<a href="#queue_awaitAll" name="queue_awaitAll">#</a> <i>queue</i>.<b>awaitAll</b>(<i>callback</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue/blob/master/src/queue.js#L39 "Source")

Sets the *callback* to be invoked when all deferred tasks have finished. The first argument to the *callback* is the first error that occurred, or null if no error occurred. If an error occurred, there are no additional arguments to the callback. Otherwise, the *callback* is also passed an array of results as the second argument. For example:

```js
d3.queue()
    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + "/../Makefile")
    .defer(fs.stat, __dirname + "/../package.json")
    .awaitAll(function(error, files) { console.log(files); });
```

If all [deferred](#queue_defer) tasks have already completed, the callback will be invoked immediately. This method may only be called once, after any tasks have been deferred. If this method is called multiple times, or if it is called after [*queue*.await](#queue_await), an error is thrown. If the *callback* is not a function, an error is thrown.

# d3-random

Generate random numbers from various distributions.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-random`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-random.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-random.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var random = d3.randomUniform(1, 10);

</script>
```

[Try d3-random in your browser.](https://runkit.com/npm/d3-random)

## API Reference

<a name="randomUniform" href="#randomUniform">#</a> d3.<b>randomUniform</b>([<i>min</i>, ][<i>max</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/src/uniform.js "Source")

Returns a function for generating random numbers with a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_\(continuous\)). The minimum allowed value of a returned number is *min*, and the maximum is *max*. If *min* is not specified, it defaults to 0; if *max* is not specified, it defaults to 1. For example:

```js
d3.randomUniform(6)(); // Returns a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 6.
d3.randomUniform(1, 5)(); // Returns a number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 5.
```

Note that you can also use the built-in [Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) to generate uniform distributions directly. For example, to generate a random integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), you can say `Math.random() * 100 | 0`.

<a name="randomNormal" href="#randomNormal">#</a> d3.<b>randomNormal</b>([<i>mu</i>][, <i>sigma</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/src/normal.js "Source")

Returns a function for generating random numbers with a [normal (Gaussian) distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). The expected value of the generated numbers is *mu*, with the given standard deviation *sigma*. If *mu* is not specified, it defaults to 0; if *sigma* is not specified, it defaults to 1.

<a name="randomLogNormal" href="#randomLogNormal">#</a> d3.<b>randomLogNormal</b>([<i>mu</i>][, <i>sigma</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/src/logNormal.js "Source")

Returns a function for generating random numbers with a [log-normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution). The expected value of the random variables natural logarithm is *mu*, with the given standard deviation *sigma*. If *mu* is not specified, it defaults to 0; if *sigma* is not specified, it defaults to 1.

<a name="randomBates" href="#randomBates">#</a> d3.<b>randomBates</b>(<i>n</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/src/bates.js "Source")

Returns a function for generating random numbers with a [Bates distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_distribution) with *n* independent variables.

<a name="randomIrwinHall" href="#randomIrwinHall">#</a> d3.<b>randomIrwinHall</b>(<i>n</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/src/irwinHall.js "Source")

Returns a function for generating random numbers with an [IrwinHall distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IrwinHall_distribution) with *n* independent variables.

<a name="randomExponential" href="#randomExponential">#</a> d3.<b>randomExponential</b>(<i>lambda</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-random/blob/master/src/exponential.js "Source")

Returns a function for generating random numbers with an [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) with the rate *lambda*; equivalent to time between events in a [Poisson process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process) with a mean of 1 / *lambda*. For example, exponential(1/40) generates random times between events where, on average, one event occurs every 40 units of time.

<a name="random_source" href="#random_source">#</a> <i>random</i>.<b>source</b>(<i>source</i>)

Returns the same type of function for generating random numbers but where the given random number generator *source* is used as the source of randomness instead of Math.random. The given random number generator must implement the same interface as Math.random and only return values in the range [0, 1). This is useful when a seeded random number generator is preferable to Math.random. For example:

```js
var d3 = require("d3-random"),
    seedrandom = require("seedrandom"),
    random = d3.randomNormal.source(seedrandom("a22ebc7c488a3a47"))(0, 1);

random(); // 0.9744193494813501
```

File: ./node_modules/d3-request/README.md
# d3-request

This module provides a convenient alternative to XMLHttpRequest. For example, to load a text file:

```js
d3.text("/path/to/file.txt", function(error, text) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log(text); // Hello, world!
});
```

To load and parse a CSV file:

```js
d3.csv("/path/to/file.csv", function(error, data) {
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log(data); // [{"Hello": "world"}, ]
});
```

To post some query parameters:

```js
d3.request("/path/to/resource")
    .header("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")
    .header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
    .post("a=2&b=3", callback);
```

This module has built-in support for parsing [JSON](#json), [CSV](#csv) and [TSV](#tsv); in browsers, but not in Node, [HTML](#html) and [XML](#xml) are also supported. You can parse additional formats by using [request](#request) or [text](#text) directly.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-request`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-request.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-collection.v1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-dispatch.v1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-dsv.v1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-request.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

d3.csv("/path/to/file.csv", callback);

</script>
```

[Try d3-request in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-request)

## API Reference

<a name="request" href="#request">#</a> d3.<b>request</b>(<i>url</i>[, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L4 "Source")

Returns a new *request* for specified *url*. If no *callback* is specified, the returned *request* is not yet [sent](#request_send) and can be further configured. If a *callback* is specified, it is equivalent to calling [*request*.get](#request_get) immediately after construction:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .get(callback);
```

If you wish to specify a request header or a mime type, you must *not* specify a callback to the constructor. Use [*request*.header](#request_header) or [*request*.mimeType](#request_mimeType) followed by [*request*.get](#request_get) instead. See [d3.json](#json), [d3.csv](#csv), [d3.tsv](#tsv), [d3.html](#html) and [d3.xml](#xml) for content-specific convenience constructors.

<a name="request_header" href="#request_header">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>header</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L51 "Source")

If *value* is specified, sets the request header with the specified *name* to the specified value and returns this request instance. If *value* is null, removes the request header with the specified *name* instead. If *value* is not specified, returns the current value of the request header with the specified *name*. Header names are case-insensitive.

Request headers can only be modified before the request is [sent](#request_send). Therefore, you cannot pass a callback to the [request constructor](#request) if you wish to specify a header; use [*request*.get](#request_get) or similar instead. For example:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .header("Accept-Language", "en-US")
    .header("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest")
    .get(callback);
```

Note: this library does not set the X-Requested-With header to `XMLHttpRequest` by default. Some servers require this header to mitigate unwanted requests, but the presence of the header triggers CORS preflight checks; if necessary, set this header before sending the request.

<a name="request_mimeType" href="#request_mimeType">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>mimeType</b>([<i>type</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L60 "Source")

If *type* is specified, sets the request mime type to the specified value and returns this request instance. If *type* is null, clears the current mime type (if any) instead. If *type* is not specified, returns the current mime type, which defaults to null. The mime type is used to both set the ["Accept" request header](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html) and for [overrideMimeType](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-overridemimetype%28%29-method), where supported.

The request mime type can only be modified before the request is [sent](#request_send). Therefore, you cannot pass a callback to the [request constructor](#request) if you wish to override the mime type; use [*request*.get](#request_get) or similar instead. For example:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/csv")
    .get(callback);
```

<a name="request_user" href="#request_user">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>user</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L80 "Source")

If *value* is specified, sets the user name for authentication to the specified string and returns this request instance. If *value* is not specified, returns the current user name, which defaults to null.

<a name="request_password" href="#request_password">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>password</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L84 "Source")

If *value* is specified, sets the password for authentication to the specified string and returns this request instance. If *value* is not specified, returns the current password, which defaults to null.

<a name="request_timeout" href="#request_timeout">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>timeout</b>([<i>timeout</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L74 "Source")

If *timeout* is specified, sets the [timeout](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-timeout-attribute) attribute of the request to the specified number of milliseconds and returns this request instance. If *timeout* is not specified, returns the current response timeout, which defaults to 0.

<a name="request_responseType" href="#request_responseType">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>responseType</b>([<i>type</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L68 "Source")

If *type* is specified, sets the [response type](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-responsetype-attribute) attribute of the request and returns this request instance. Typical values are: `` (the empty string), `arraybuffer`, `blob`, `document`, and `text`. If *type* is not specified, returns the current response type, which defaults to ``.

<a name="request_response" href="#request_response">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>response</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L90 "Source")

Sets the response value function to the specified function and returns this request instance. The response value function is used to map the response XMLHttpRequest object to a useful data value. See the convenience methods [json](#json) and [text](#text) for examples.

<a name="request_get" href="#request_get">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>get</b>([<i>data</i>][, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L96 "Source")

Equivalent to [*request*.send](#request_send) with the GET method:

```js
request.send("GET", data, callback);
```

<a name="request_post" href="#request_post">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>post</b>([<i>data</i>][, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L101 "Source")

Equivalent to [*request*.send](#request_send) with the POST method:

```js
request.send("POST", data, callback);
```

<a name="request_send" href="#request_send">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>send</b>(<i>method</i>[, <i>data</i>][, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L106 "Source")

Issues this request using the specified *method* (such as `GET` or `POST`), optionally posting the specified *data* in the request body, and returns this request instance. If a *callback* is specified, the callback will be invoked asynchronously when the request succeeds or fails. The callback is invoked with two arguments: the error, if any, and the [response value](#request_response). The response value is undefined if an error occurs. This is equivalent to:

```js
request
    .on("error", function(error) { callback(error); })
    .on("load", function(xhr) { callback(null, xhr); })
    .send(method, data);
```

If no *callback* is specified, then "load" and "error" listeners should be registered via [*request*.on](#request_on).

<a name="request_abort" href="#request_abort">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>abort</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L121 "Source")

Aborts this request, if it is currently in-flight, and returns this request instance. See [XMLHttpRequests abort](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-abort%28%29-method).

<a name="request_on" href="#request_on">#</a> <i>request</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>type</i>[, <i>listener</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/request.js#L126 "Source")

If *listener* is specified, sets the event *listener* for the specified *type* and returns this request instance. If an event listener was already registered for the same type, the existing listener is removed before the new listener is added. If *listener* is null, removes the current event *listener* for the specified *type* (if any) instead. If *listener* is not specified, returns the currently-assigned listener for the specified type, if any.

The type must be one of the following:

* `beforesend` - to allow custom headers and the like to be set before the request is [sent](#request_send).
* `progress` - to monitor the [progress of the request](http://www.w3.org/TR/progress-events/).
* `load` - when the request completes successfully.
* `error` - when the request completes unsuccessfully; this includes 4xx and 5xx response codes.

To register multiple listeners for the same *type*, the type may be followed by an optional name, such as `load.foo` and `load.bar`. See [d3-dispatch](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch) for details.

<a name="csv" href="#csv">#</a> d3.<b>csv</b>(<i>url</i>[[, <i>row</i>], <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/csv.js "Source")

Returns a new [*request*](#request) for the [CSV](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv#csvParse) file at the specified *url* with the default mime type `text/csv`. If no *callback* is specified, this is equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/csv")
    .response(function(xhr) { return d3.csvParse(xhr.responseText, row); });
```

If a *callback* is specified, a [GET](#request_get) request is sent, making it equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/csv")
    .response(function(xhr) { return d3.csvParse(xhr.responseText, row); })
    .get(callback);
```

An optional *row* conversion function may be specified to map and filter row objects to a more-specific representation; see [*dsv*.parse](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv#dsv_parse) for details. For example:

```js
function row(d) {
  return {
    year: new Date(+d.Year, 0, 1), // convert "Year" column to Date
    make: d.Make,
    model: d.Model,
    length: +d.Length // convert "Length" column to number
  };
}
```

The returned *request* exposes an additional *request*.row method as an alternative to passing the *row* conversion function to d3.csv, allowing you to configure the request before sending it. For example, this:

```js
d3.csv(url, row, callback);
```

Is equivalent to this:

```js
d3.csv(url)
    .row(row)
    .get(callback);
```

<a name="html" href="#html">#</a> d3.<b>html</b>(<i>url</i>[, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/html.js "Source")

Returns a new [*request*](#request) for the HTML file at the specified *url* with the default mime type `text/html`. The HTML file is returned as a [document fragment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/range.createContextualFragment). If no *callback* is specified, this is equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/html")
    .response(function(xhr) { return document.createRange().createContextualFragment(xhr.responseText); });
```

If a *callback* is specified, a [GET](#request_get) request is sent, making it equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/html")
    .response(function(xhr) { return document.createRange().createContextualFragment(xhr.responseText); })
    .get(callback);
```

HTML parsing requires a global document and relies on [DOM Ranges](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#ranges), which are [not supported by JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/317) as of version 8.3; thus, this method is supported in browsers but not in Node.

<a name="json" href="#json">#</a> d3.<b>json</b>(<i>url</i>[, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/json.js "Source")

Returns a new [*request*](#request) to [get](#request_get) the [JSON](http://json.org) file at the specified *url* with the default mime type `application/json`. If no *callback* is specified, this is equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("application/json")
    .response(function(xhr) { return JSON.parse(xhr.responseText); });
```

If a *callback* is specified, a [GET](#request_get) request is sent, making it equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("application/json")
    .response(function(xhr) { return JSON.parse(xhr.responseText); })
    .get(callback);
```

<a name="text" href="#text">#</a> d3.<b>text</b>(<i>url</i>[, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/text.js "Source")

Returns a new [*request*](#request) to [get](#request_get) the text file at the specified *url* with the default mime type `text/plain`. If no *callback* is specified, this is equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/plain")
    .response(function(xhr) { return xhr.responseText; });
```

If a *callback* is specified, a [GET](#request_get) request is sent, making it equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/plain")
    .response(function(xhr) { return xhr.responseText; })
    .get(callback);
```

<a name="tsv" href="#tsv">#</a> d3.<b>tsv</b>(<i>url</i>[[, <i>row</i>], <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/tsv.js "Source")

Returns a new [*request*](#request) for a [TSV](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv#tsvParse) file at the specified *url* with the default mime type `text/tab-separated-values`. If no *callback* is specified, this is equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/tab-separated-values")
    .response(function(xhr) { return d3.tsvParse(xhr.responseText, row); });
```

If a *callback* is specified, a [GET](#request_get) request is sent, making it equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("text/tab-separated-values")
    .response(function(xhr) { return d3.tsvParse(xhr.responseText, row); })
    .get(callback);
```

An optional *row* conversion function may be specified to map and filter row objects to a more-specific representation; see [*dsv*.parse](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv#dsv_parse) for details. For example:

```js
function row(d) {
  return {
    year: new Date(+d.Year, 0, 1), // convert "Year" column to Date
    make: d.Make,
    model: d.Model,
    length: +d.Length // convert "Length" column to number
  };
}
```

The returned *request* exposes an additional *request*.row method as an alternative to passing the *row* conversion function to d3.tsv, allowing you to configure the request before sending it. For example, this:

```js
d3.tsv(url, row, callback);
```

Is equivalent to this:

```js
d3.tsv(url)
    .row(row)
    .get(callback);
```

<a name="xml" href="#xml">#</a> d3.<b>xml</b>(<i>url</i>[, <i>callback</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/src/xml.js "Source")

Returns a new [*request*](#request) to [get](#request_get) the XML file at the specified *url* with the default mime type `application/xml`. If no *callback* is specified, this is equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("application/xml")
    .response(function(xhr) { return xhr.responseXML; });
```

If a *callback* is specified, a [GET](#request_get) request is sent, making it equivalent to:

```js
d3.request(url)
    .mimeType("application/xml")
    .response(function(xhr) { return xhr.responseXML; })
    .get(callback);
```

XML parsing relies on [*xhr*.responseXML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/responseXML) which is not supported by [node-XMLHttpRequest](https://github.com/driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest/issues/8) as of version 1.8; thus, this method is supported in browsers but not in Node.

# d3-scale

Scales are a convenient abstraction for a fundamental task in visualization: mapping a dimension of abstract data to a visual representation. Although most often used for position-encoding quantitative data, such as mapping a measurement in meters to a position in pixels for dots in a scatterplot, scales can represent virtually any visual encoding, such as diverging colors, stroke widths, or symbol size. Scales can also be used with virtually any type of data, such as named categorical data or discrete data that requires sensible breaks.

For [continuous](#continuous-scales) quantitative data, you typically want a [linear scale](#linear-scales). (For time series data, a [time scale](#time-scales).) If the distribution calls for it, consider transforming data using a [power](#power-scales) or [log](#log-scales) scale. A [quantize scale](#quantize-scales) may aid differentiation by rounding continuous data to a fixed set of discrete values; similarly, a [quantile scale](#quantile-scales) computes quantiles from a sample population, and a [threshold scale](#threshold-scales) allows you to specify arbitrary breaks in continuous data. Several built-in [sequential color schemes](#sequential-scales) are also provided; see [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic) for more.

For discrete ordinal (ordered) or categorical (unordered) data, an [ordinal scale](#ordinal-scales) specifies an explicit mapping from a set of data values to a corresponding set of visual attributes (such as colors). The related [band](#band-scales) and [point](#point-scales) scales are useful for position-encoding ordinal data, such as bars in a bar chart or dots in an categorical scatterplot. Several built-in [categorical color scales](#category-scales) are also provided.

Scales have no intrinsic visual representation. However, most scales can [generate](#continuous_ticks) and [format](#continuous_tickFormat) ticks for reference marks to aid in the construction of axes.

### Continuous Scales

Continuous scales map a continuous, quantitative input [domain](#continuous_domain) to a continuous output [range](#continuous_range). If the range is also numeric, the mapping may be [inverted](#continuous_invert). A continuous scale is not constructed directly; instead, try a [linear](#linear-scales), [power](#power-scales), [log](#log-scales), [identity](#identity-scales), [time](#time-scales) or [sequential color](#sequential-scales) scale.

<a name="_continuous" href="#_continuous">#</a> <i>continuous</i>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L69 "Source")

Given a *value* from the [domain](#continuous_domain), returns the corresponding value from the [range](#continuous_range). If the given *value* is outside the domain, and [clamping](#continuous_clamp) is not enabled, the mapping may be extrapolated such that the returned value is outside the range. For example, to apply a position encoding:

```js
var x = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([10, 130])
    .range([0, 960]);

x(20); // 80
x(50); // 320
```

Or to apply a color encoding:

```js
var color = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([10, 100])
    .range(["brown", "steelblue"]);

color(20); // "#9a3439"
color(50); // "#7b5167"
```

<a name="continuous_invert" href="#continuous_invert">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>invert</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L88 "Source")

Given a *value* from the [range](#continuous_range), returns the corresponding value from the [domain](#continuous_domain). Inversion is useful for interaction, say to determine the data value corresponding to the position of the mouse. For example, to invert a position encoding:

```js
var x = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([10, 130])
    .range([0, 960]);

x.invert(80); // 20
x.invert(320); // 50
```

If the given *value* is outside the range, and [clamping](#continuous_clamp) is not enabled, the mapping may be extrapolated such that the returned value is outside the domain. This method is only supported if the range is numeric. If the range is not numeric, returns NaN.

For a valid value *y* in the range, <i>continuous</i>(<i>continuous</i>.invert(<i>y</i>)) approximately equals *y*; similarly, for a valid value *x* in the domain, <i>continuous</i>.invert(<i>continuous</i>(<i>x</i>)) approximately equals *x*. The scale and its inverse may not be exact due to the limitations of floating point precision.

<a name="continuous_domain" href="#continuous_domain">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L92 "Source")

If *domain* is specified, sets the scales domain to the specified array of numbers. The array must contain two or more elements. If the elements in the given array are not numbers, they will be coerced to numbers. If *domain* is not specified, returns a copy of the scales current domain.

Although continuous scales typically have two values each in their domain and range, specifying more than two values produces a piecewise scale. For example, to create a diverging color scale that interpolates between white and red for negative values, and white and green for positive values, say:

```js
var color = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([-1, 0, 1])
    .range(["red", "white", "green"]);

color(-0.5); // "rgb(255, 128, 128)"
color(+0.5); // "rgb(128, 192, 128)"
```

Internally, a piecewise scale performs a [binary search](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#bisect) for the range interpolator corresponding to the given domain value. Thus, the domain must be in ascending or descending order. If the domain and range have different lengths *N* and *M*, only the first *min(N,M)* elements in each are observed.

<a name="continuous_range" href="#continuous_range">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L96 "Source")

If *range* is specified, sets the scales range to the specified array of values. The array must contain two or more elements. Unlike the [domain](#continuous_domain), elements in the given array need not be numbers; any value that is supported by the underlying [interpolator](#continuous_interpolate) will work, though note that numeric ranges are required for [invert](#continuous_invert). If *range* is not specified, returns a copy of the scales current range. See [*continuous*.interpolate](#continuous_interpolate) for more examples.

<a name="continuous_rangeRound" href="#continuous_rangeRound">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>rangeRound</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L100 "Source")

Sets the scales [*range*](#continuous_range) to the specified array of values while also setting the scales [interpolator](#continuous_interpolate) to [interpolateRound](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateRound). This is a convenience method equivalent to:

```js
continuous
    .range(range)
    .interpolate(d3.interpolateRound);
```

The rounding interpolator is sometimes useful for avoiding antialiasing artifacts, though also consider the [shape-rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/shape-rendering) crispEdges styles. Note that this interpolator can only be used with numeric ranges.

<a name="continuous_clamp" href="#continuous_clamp">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>clamp</b>(<i>clamp</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L104 "Source")

If *clamp* is specified, enables or disables clamping accordingly. If clamping is disabled and the scale is passed a value outside the [domain](#continuous_domain), the scale may return a value outside the [range](#continuous_range) through extrapolation. If clamping is enabled, the return value of the scale is always within the scales range. Clamping similarly applies to [*continuous*.invert](#continuous_invert). For example:

```js
var x = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([10, 130])
    .range([0, 960]);

x(-10); // -160, outside range
x.invert(-160); // -10, outside domain

x.clamp(true);
x(-10); // 0, clamped to range
x.invert(-160); // 10, clamped to domain
```

If *clamp* is not specified, returns whether or not the scale currently clamps values to within the range.

<a name="continuous_interpolate" href="#continuous_interpolate">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>interpolate</b>(<i>interpolate</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L108 "Source")

If *interpolate* is specified, sets the scales [range](#continuous_range) interpolator factory. This interpolator factory is used to create interpolators for each adjacent pair of values from the range; these interpolators then map a normalized domain parameter *t* in [0, 1] to the corresponding value in the range. If *factory* is not specified, returns the scales current interpolator factory, which defaults to [interpolate](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolate). See [d3-interpolate](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate) for more interpolators.

For example, consider a diverging color scale with three colors in the range:

```js
var color = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([-100, 0, +100])
    .range(["red", "white", "green"]);
```

Two interpolators are created internally by the scale, equivalent to:

```js
var i0 = d3.interpolate("red", "white"),
    i1 = d3.interpolate("white", "green");
```

A common reason to specify a custom interpolator is to change the color space of interpolation. For example, to use [HCL](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateHcl):

```js
var color = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([10, 100])
    .range(["brown", "steelblue"])
    .interpolate(d3.interpolateHcl);
```

Or for [Cubehelix](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateCubehelix) with a custom gamma:

```js
var color = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([10, 100])
    .range(["brown", "steelblue"])
    .interpolate(d3.interpolateCubehelix.gamma(3));
```

Note: the [default interpolator](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolate) **may reuse return values**. For example, if the range values are objects, then the value interpolator always returns the same object, modifying it in-place. If the scale is used to set an attribute or style, this is typically acceptable (and desirable for performance); however, if you need to store the scales return value, you must specify your own interpolator or make a copy as appropriate.

<a name="continuous_ticks" href="#continuous_ticks">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>ticks</b>([<i>count</i>])

Returns approximately *count* representative values from the scales [domain](#continuous_domain). If *count* is not specified, it defaults to 10. The returned tick values are uniformly spaced, have human-readable values (such as multiples of powers of 10), and are guaranteed to be within the extent of the domain. Ticks are often used to display reference lines, or tick marks, in conjunction with the visualized data. The specified *count* is only a hint; the scale may return more or fewer values depending on the domain. See also d3-arrays [ticks](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ticks).

<a name="continuous_tickFormat" href="#continuous_tickFormat">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>tickFormat</b>([<i>count</i>[, <i>specifier</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/tickFormat.js "Source")

Returns a [number format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) function suitable for displaying a tick value, automatically computing the appropriate precision based on the fixed interval between tick values. The specified *count* should have the same value as the count that is used to generate the [tick values](#continuous_ticks).

An optional *specifier* allows a [custom format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format) where the precision of the format is automatically set by the scale as appropriate for the tick interval. For example, to format percentage change, you might say:

```js
var x = d3.scaleLinear()
    .domain([-1, 1])
    .range([0, 960]);

var ticks = x.ticks(5),
    tickFormat = x.tickFormat(5, "+%");

ticks.map(tickFormat); // ["-100%", "-50%", "+0%", "+50%", "+100%"]
```

If *specifier* uses the format type `s`, the scale will return a [SI-prefix format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_formatPrefix) based on the largest value in the domain. If the *specifier* already specifies a precision, this method is equivalent to [*locale*.format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format).

<a name="continuous_nice" href="#continuous_nice">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>nice</b>([<i>count</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/nice.js "Source")

Extends the [domain](#continuous_domain) so that it starts and ends on nice round values. This method typically modifies the scales domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. An optional tick *count* argument allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned [ticks](#continuous_ticks) will exactly cover the domain. Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data, say using [extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#extent), and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [0.201479, 0.996679], a nice domain might be [0.2, 1.0]. If the domain has more than two values, nicing the domain only affects the first and last value. See also d3-arrays [tickStep](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#tickStep).

Nicing a scale only modifies the current domain; it does not automatically nice domains that are subsequently set using [*continuous*.domain](#continuous_domain). You must re-nice the scale after setting the new domain, if desired.

<a name="continuous_copy" href="#continuous_copy">#</a> <i>continuous</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L59 "Source")

Returns an exact copy of this scale. Changes to this scale will not affect the returned scale, and vice versa.

#### Linear Scales

<a name="scaleLinear" href="#scaleLinear">#</a> d3.<b>scaleLinear</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/linear.js "Source")

Constructs a new [continuous scale](#continuous-scales) with the unit [domain](#continuous_domain) [0, 1], the unit [range](#continuous_range) [0, 1], the [default](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolate) [interpolator](#continuous_interpolate) and [clamping](#continuous_clamp) disabled. Linear scales are a good default choice for continuous quantitative data because they preserve proportional differences. Each range value *y* can be expressed as a function of the domain value *x*: *y* = *mx* + *b*.

#### Power Scales

Power scales are similar to [linear scales](#linear-scales), except an exponential transform is applied to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. Each range value *y* can be expressed as a function of the domain value *x*: *y* = *mx^k* + *b*, where *k* is the [exponent](#pow_exponent) value. Power scales also support negative domain values, in which case the input value and the resulting output value are multiplied by -1.

<a name="scalePow" href="#scalePow">#</a> d3.<b>scalePow</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/pow.js "Source")

Constructs a new [continuous scale](#continuous-scales) with the unit [domain](#continuous_domain) [0, 1], the unit [range](#continuous_range) [0, 1], the [exponent](#pow_exponent) 1, the [default](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolate) [interpolator](#continuous_interpolate) and [clamping](#continuous_clamp) disabled. (Note that this is effectively a [linear](#linear-scales) scale until you set a different exponent.)

<a name="pow" href="#_pow">#</a> <i>pow</i>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/pow.js#L9 "Source")

See [*continuous*](#_continuous).

<a name="pow_invert" href="#pow_invert">#</a> <i>pow</i>.<b>invert</b>(<i>value</i>)

See [*continuous*.invert](#continuous_invert).

<a name="pow_exponent" href="#pow_exponent">#</a> <i>pow</i>.<b>exponent</b>([<i>exponent</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/pow.js#L25 "Source")

If *exponent* is specified, sets the current exponent to the given numeric value. If *exponent* is not specified, returns the current exponent, which defaults to 1. (Note that this is effectively a [linear](#linear-scales) scale until you set a different exponent.)

<a name="pow_domain" href="#pow_domain">#</a> <i>pow</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>])

<a name="scaleSqrt" href="#scaleSqrt">#</a> d3.<b>scaleSqrt</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/pow.js#L36 "Source")

Constructs a new [continuous](#continuous-scales) [power scale](#power-scales) with the unit [domain](#continuous_domain) [0, 1], the unit [range](#continuous_range) [0, 1], the [exponent](#pow_exponent) 0.5, the [default](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolate) [interpolator](#continuous_interpolate) and [clamping](#continuous_clamp) disabled. This is a convenience method equivalent to `d3.scalePow().exponent(0.5)`.

#### Log Scales

Log scales are similar to [linear scales](#linear-scales), except a logarithmic transform is applied to the input domain value before the output range value is computed. The mapping to the range value *y* can be expressed as a function of the domain value *x*: *y* = *m* log(<i>x</i>) + *b*.

As log(0) = -, a log scale domain must be **strictly-positive or strictly-negative**; the domain must not include or cross zero. A log scale with a positive domain has a well-defined behavior for positive values, and a log scale with a negative domain has a well-defined behavior for negative values. (For a negative domain, input and output values are implicitly multiplied by -1.) The behavior of the scale is undefined if you pass a negative value to a log scale with a positive domain or vice versa.

<a name="scaleLog" href="#scaleLog">#</a> d3.<b>scaleLog</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js "Source")

Constructs a new [continuous scale](#continuous-scales) with the [domain](#log_domain) [1, 10], the unit [range](#log_range) [0, 1], the [base](#log_base) 10, the [default](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolate) [interpolator](#log_interpolate) and [clamping](#log_clamp) disabled.

<a name="log" href="#_log">#</a> <i>log</i>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js#L42 "Source")

See [*continuous*](#_continuous).

<a name="log_invert" href="#log_invert">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>invert</b>(<i>value</i>)

See [*continuous*.invert](#continuous_invert).

<a name="log_base" href="#log_base">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>base</b>([<i>base</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js#L55 "Source")

If *base* is specified, sets the base for this logarithmic scale to the specified value. If *base* is not specified, returns the current base, which defaults to 10.

<a name="log_domain" href="#log_domain">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js#L59 "Source")

See [*continuous*.domain](#continuous_domain).

<a name="log_range" href="#log_range">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/continuous.js#L96 "Source")

See [*continuous*.range](#continuous_range).

<a name="log_rangeRound" href="#log_rangeRound">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>rangeRound</b>([<i>range</i>])

See [*continuous*.rangeRound](#continuous_rangeRound).

<a name="log_clamp" href="#log_clamp">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>clamp</b>(<i>clamp</i>)

See [*continuous*.clamp](#continuous_clamp).

<a name="log_interpolate" href="#log_interpolate">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>interpolate</b>(<i>interpolate</i>)

See [*continuous*.interpolate](#continuous_interpolate).

<a name="log_ticks" href="#log_ticks">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>ticks</b>([<i>count</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js#L63 "Source")

Like [*continuous*.ticks](#continuous_ticks), but customized for a log scale. If the [base](#log_base) is an integer, the returned ticks are uniformly spaced within each integer power of base; otherwise, one tick per power of base is returned. The returned ticks are guaranteed to be within the extent of the domain. If the orders of magnitude in the [domain](#log_domain) is greater than *count*, then at most one tick per power is returned. Otherwise, the tick values are unfiltered, but note that you can use [*log*.tickFormat](#log_tickFormat) to filter the display of tick labels. If *count* is not specified, it defaults to 10.

<a name="log_tickFormat" href="#log_tickFormat">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>tickFormat</b>([<i>count</i>[, <i>specifier</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js#L103 "Source")

Like [*continuous*.tickFormat](#continuous_tickFormat), but customized for a log scale. The specified *count* typically has the same value as the count that is used to generate the [tick values](#continuous_ticks). If there are too many ticks, the formatter may return the empty string for some of the tick labels; however, note that the ticks are still shown. To disable filtering, specify a *count* of Infinity. When specifying a count, you may also provide a format *specifier* or format function. For example, to get a tick formatter that will display 20 ticks of a currency, say `log.tickFormat(20, "$,f")`. If the specifier does not have a defined precision, the precision will be set automatically by the scale, returning the appropriate format. This provides a convenient way of specifying a format whose precision will be automatically set by the scale.

<a name="log_nice" href="#log_nice">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>nice</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js#L116 "Source")

Like [*continuous*.nice](#continuous_nice), except extends the domain to integer powers of [base](#log_base). For example, for a domain of [0.201479, 0.996679], and base 10, the nice domain is [0.1, 1]. If the domain has more than two values, nicing the domain only affects the first and last value.

<a name="log_copy" href="#log_copy">#</a> <i>log</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/log.js#L123 "Source")

See [*continuous*.copy](#continuous_copy).

#### Identity Scales

Identity scales are a special case of [linear scales](#linear-scales) where the domain and range are identical; the scale and its invert method are thus the identity function. These scales are occasionally useful when working with pixel coordinates, say in conjunction with an axis or brush. Identity scales do not support [rangeRound](#continuous_rangeRound), [clamp](#continuous_clamp) or [interpolate](#continuous_interpolate).

<a name="scaleIdentity" href="#scaleIdentity">#</a> d3.<b>scaleIdentity</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/identity.js "Source")

Constructs a new identity scale with the unit [domain](#continuous_domain) [0, 1] and the unit [range](#continuous_range) [0, 1].

#### Time Scales

Time scales are a variant of [linear scales](#linear-scales) that have a temporal domain: domain values are coerced to [dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) rather than numbers, and [invert](#continuous_invert) likewise returns a date. Time scales implement [ticks](#time_ticks) based on [calendar intervals](https://github.com/d3/d3-time), taking the pain out of generating axes for temporal domains.

For example, to create a position encoding:

```js
var x = d3.scaleTime()
    .domain([new Date(2000, 0, 1), new Date(2000, 0, 2)])
    .range([0, 960]);

x(new Date(2000, 0, 1,  5)); // 200
x(new Date(2000, 0, 1, 16)); // 640
x.invert(200); // Sat Jan 01 2000 05:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
x.invert(640); // Sat Jan 01 2000 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
```

For a valid value *y* in the range, <i>time</i>(<i>time</i>.invert(<i>y</i>)) equals *y*; similarly, for a valid value *x* in the domain, <i>time</i>.invert(<i>time</i>(<i>x</i>)) equals *x*. The invert method is useful for interaction, say to determine the value in the domain that corresponds to the pixel location under the mouse.

<a name="scaleTime" href="#scaleTime">#</a> d3.<b>scaleTime</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/time.js "Source")

<a name="time_ticks" href="#time_ticks">#</a> <i>time</i>.<b>ticks</b>([<i>count</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/time.js#L103 "Source")
<br><a name="time_ticks" href="#time_ticks">#</a> <i>time</i>.<b>ticks</b>([<i>interval</i>])

Returns representative dates from the scales [domain](#time_domain). The returned tick values are uniformly-spaced (mostly), have sensible values (such as every day at midnight), and are guaranteed to be within the extent of the domain. Ticks are often used to display reference lines, or tick marks, in conjunction with the visualized data.

An optional *count* may be specified to affect how many ticks are generated. If *count* is not specified, it defaults to 10. The specified *count* is only a hint; the scale may return more or fewer values depending on the domain. For example, to create ten default ticks, say:

```js
var x = d3.scaleTime();

x.ticks(10);
// [Sat Jan 01 2000 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 03:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 06:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 09:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 12:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 15:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 18:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 21:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sun Jan 02 2000 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)]
```

The following time intervals are considered for automatic ticks:

* 1-, 5-, 15- and 30-second.
* 1-, 5-, 15- and 30-minute.
* 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-hour.
* 1- and 2-day.
* 1-week.
* 1- and 3-month.
* 1-year.

In lieu of a *count*, a [time *interval*](https://github.com/d3/d3-time#intervals) may be explicitly specified. To prune the generated ticks for a given time *interval*, use [*interval*.every](https://github.com/d3/d3-time#interval_every). For example, to generate ticks at 15-[minute](https://github.com/d3/d3-time#minute) intervals:

```js
var x = d3.scaleTime()
    .domain([new Date(2000, 0, 1, 0), new Date(2000, 0, 1, 2)]);

x.ticks(d3.timeMinute.every(15));
// [Sat Jan 01 2000 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 00:15:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 00:30:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 00:45:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 01:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 01:15:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 01:30:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 01:45:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 01 2000 02:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)]
```

Alternatively, pass a test function to [*interval*.filter](https://github.com/d3/d3-time#interval_filter):

```js
x.ticks(d3.timeMinute.filter(function(d) {
  return d.getMinutes() % 15 === 0;
}));
```

Note: in some cases, such as with day ticks, specifying a *step* can result in irregular spacing of ticks because time intervals have varying length.

<a name="time_tickFormat" href="#time_tickFormat">#</a> <i>time</i>.<b>tickFormat</b>([<i>count</i>[, <i>specifier</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/time.js#L115 "Source")
<br><a href="#time_tickFormat">#</a> <i>time</i>.<b>tickFormat</b>([<i>interval</i>[, <i>specifier</i>]])

Returns a time format function suitable for displaying [tick](#time_ticks) values. The specified *count* or *interval* is currently ignored, but is accepted for consistency with other scales such as [*continuous*.tickFormat](#continuous_tickFormat). If a format *specifier* is specified, this method is equivalent to [format](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format#format). If *specifier* is not specified, the default time format is returned. The default multi-scale time format chooses a human-readable representation based on the specified date as follows:

* `%Y` - for year boundaries, such as `2011`.
* `%B` - for month boundaries, such as `February`.
* `%b %d` - for week boundaries, such as `Feb 06`.
* `%a %d` - for day boundaries, such as `Mon 07`.
* `%I %p` - for hour boundaries, such as `01 AM`.
* `%I:%M` - for minute boundaries, such as `01:23`.
* `:%S` - for second boundaries, such as `:45`.
* `.%L` - milliseconds for all other times, such as `.012`.

Although somewhat unusual, this default behavior has the benefit of providing both local and global context: for example, formatting a sequence of ticks as [11 PM, Mon 07, 01 AM] reveals information about hours, dates, and day simultaneously, rather than just the hours [11 PM, 12 AM, 01 AM]. See [d3-time-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format) if youd like to roll your own conditional time format.

<a name="time_nice" href="#time_nice">#</a> <i>time</i>.<b>nice</b>([<i>count</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/time.js#L119 "Source")
<br><a name="time_nice" href="#time_nice">#</a> <i>time</i>.<b>nice</b>([<i>interval</i>[, <i>step</i>]])

Extends the [domain](#time_domain) so that it starts and ends on nice round values. This method typically modifies the scales domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value. See [*continuous*.nice](#continuous_nice) for more.

An optional tick *count* argument allows greater control over the step size used to extend the bounds, guaranteeing that the returned [ticks](#time_ticks) will exactly cover the domain. Alternatively, a [time *interval*](https://github.com/d3/d3-time#intervals) may be specified to explicitly set the ticks. If an *interval* is specified, an optional *step* may also be specified to skip some ticks. For example, `time.nice(d3.timeSecond, 10)` will extend the domain to an even ten seconds (0, 10, 20, <i>etc.</i>). See [*time*.ticks](#time_ticks) and [*interval*.every](https://github.com/d3/d3-time#interval_every) for further detail.

Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data, say using [extent](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#extent), and may be irregular. For example, for a domain of [2009-07-13T00:02, 2009-07-13T23:48], the nice domain is [2009-07-13, 2009-07-14]. If the domain has more than two values, nicing the domain only affects the first and last value.

<a name="scaleUtc" href="#scaleUtc">#</a> d3.<b>scaleUtc</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/utcTime.js "Source")

Equivalent to [time](#time), but the returned time scale operates in [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) rather than local time.

### Sequential Scales

Sequential scales are similar to [continuous scales](#continuous-scales) in that they map a continuous, numeric input domain to a continuous output range. However, unlike continuous scales, the output range of a sequential scale is fixed by its interpolator and not configurable. These scales do not expose [invert](#continuous_invert), [range](#continuous_range), [rangeRound](#continuous_rangeRound) and [interpolate](#continuous_interpolate) methods.

<a name="scaleSequential" href="#scaleSequential">#</a> d3.<b>scaleSequential</b>(<i>interpolator</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/sequential.js "Source")

Constructs a new sequential scale with the given [*interpolator*](#sequential_interpolator) function. When the scale is [applied](#_sequential), the interpolator will be invoked with a value typically in the range [0, 1], where 0 represents the start of the domain, and 1 represents the end of the domain. For example, to implement the ill-advised [HSL](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#hsl) rainbow scale:

```js
var rainbow = d3.scaleSequential(function(t) {
  return d3.hsl(t * 360, 1, 0.5) + "";
});
```

A more aesthetically-pleasing and perceptually-effective cyclical hue encoding is to use [d3.interpolateRainbow](#interpolateRainbow):

```js
var rainbow = d3.scaleSequential(d3.interpolateRainbow);
```

For even more sequential color schemes, see [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic).

### Quantize Scales

Quantize scales are similar to [linear scales](#linear-scales), except they use a discrete rather than continuous range. The continuous input domain is divided into uniform segments based on the number of values in (*i.e.*, the cardinality of) the output range. Each range value *y* can be expressed as a quantized linear function of the domain value *x*: *y* = *m round(x)* + *b*. See [bl.ocks.org/4060606](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606) for an example.

<a name="scaleQuantize" href="#scaleQuantize">#</a> d3.<b>scaleQuantize</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantize.js "Source")

Constructs a new quantize scale with the unit [domain](#quantize_domain) [0, 1] and the unit [range](#quantize_range) [0, 1]. Thus, the default quantize scale is equivalent to the [Math.round](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round) function.

<a name="_quantize" href="#_quantize">#</a> <i>quantize</i>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantize.js#L5 "Source")

Given a *value* in the input [domain](#quantize_domain), returns the corresponding value in the output [range](#quantize_range). For example, to apply a color encoding:

```js
var color = d3.scaleQuantize()
    .domain([0, 1])
    .range(["brown", "steelblue"]);

color(0.49); // "brown"
color(0.51); // "steelblue"
```

Or dividing the domain into three equally-sized parts with different range values to compute an appropriate stroke width:

```js
var width = d3.scaleQuantize()
    .domain([10, 100])
    .range([1, 2, 4]);

width(20); // 1
width(50); // 2
width(80); // 4
```

<a name="quantize_invertExtent" href="#quantize_invertExtent">#</a> <i>quantize</i>.<b>invertExtent</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantize.js#L31 "Source")

Returns the extent of values in the [domain](#quantize_domain) [<i>x0</i>, <i>x1</i>] for the corresponding *value* in the [range](#quantize_range): the inverse of [*quantize*](#_quantize). This method is useful for interaction, say to determine the value in the domain that corresponds to the pixel location under the mouse.

```js
var width = d3.scaleQuantize()
    .domain([10, 100])
    .range([1, 2, 4]);

width.invertExtent(2); // [40, 70]
```

<a name="quantize_domain" href="#quantize_domain">#</a> <i>quantize</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantize.js#L23 "Source")

If *domain* is specified, sets the scales domain to the specified two-element array of numbers. If the elements in the given array are not numbers, they will be coerced to numbers. If *domain* is not specified, returns the scales current domain.

<a name="quantize_range" href="#quantize_range">#</a> <i>quantize</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantize.js#L27 "Source")

If *range* is specified, sets the scales range to the specified array of values. The array may contain any number of discrete values. The elements in the given array need not be numbers; any value or type will work. If *range* is not specified, returns the scales current range.

<a name="quantize_ticks" href="#quantize_ticks">#</a> <i>quantize</i>.<b>ticks</b>([<i>count</i>])

Equivalent to [*continuous*.ticks](#continuous_ticks).

<a name="quantize_tickFormat" href="#quantize_tickFormat">#</a> <i>quantize</i>.<b>tickFormat</b>([<i>count</i>[, <i>specifier</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/linear.js#L14 "Source")

<a name="quantize_nice" href="#quantize_nice">#</a> <i>quantize</i>.<b>nice</b>()

Equivalent to [*continuous*.nice](#continuous_nice).

<a name="quantize_copy" href="#quantize_copy">#</a> <i>quantize</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantize.js#L39 "Source")

Returns an exact copy of this scale. Changes to this scale will not affect the returned scale, and vice versa.

### Quantile Scales

Quantile scales map a sampled input domain to a discrete range. The domain is considered continuous and thus the scale will accept any reasonable input value; however, the domain is specified as a discrete set of sample values. The number of values in (the cardinality of) the output range determines the number of quantiles that will be computed from the domain. To compute the quantiles, the domain is sorted, and treated as a [population of discrete values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Quantiles_of_a_population); see d3-arrays [quantile](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#quantile). See [bl.ocks.org/8ca036b3505121279daf](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/8ca036b3505121279daf) for an example.

<a name="scaleQuantile" href="#scaleQuantile">#</a> d3.<b>scaleQuantile</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantile.js "Source")

Constructs a new quantile scale with an empty [domain](#quantile_domain) and an empty [range](#quantile_range). The quantile scale is invalid until both a domain and range are specified.

<a name="_quantile" href="#_quantile">#</a> <i>quantile</i>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantile.js#L4 "Source")

Given a *value* in the input [domain](#quantile_domain), returns the corresponding value in the output [range](#quantile_range).

<a name="quantile_invertExtent" href="#quantile_invertExtent">#</a> <i>quantile</i>.<b>invertExtent</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantile.js#L20 "Source")

Returns the extent of values in the [domain](#quantile_domain) [<i>x0</i>, <i>x1</i>] for the corresponding *value* in the [range](#quantile_range): the inverse of [*quantile*](#_quantile). This method is useful for interaction, say to determine the value in the domain that corresponds to the pixel location under the mouse.

<a name="quantile_domain" href="#quantile_domain">#</a> <i>quantile</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantile.js#L28 "Source")

If *domain* is specified, sets the domain of the quantile scale to the specified set of discrete numeric values. The array must not be empty, and must contain at least one numeric value; NaN, null and undefined values are ignored and not considered part of the sample population. If the elements in the given array are not numbers, they will be coerced to numbers. A copy of the input array is sorted and stored internally. If *domain* is not specified, returns the scales current domain.

<a name="quantile_range" href="#quantile_range">#</a> <i>quantile</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantile.js#L36 "Source")

If *range* is specified, sets the discrete values in the range. The array must not be empty, and may contain any type of value. The number of values in (the cardinality, or length, of) the *range* array determines the number of quantiles that are computed. For example, to compute quartiles, *range* must be an array of four elements such as [0, 1, 2, 3]. If *range* is not specified, returns the current range.

<a name="quantile_quantiles" href="#quantile_quantiles">#</a> <i>quantile</i>.<b>quantiles</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantile.js#L40 "Source")

Returns the quantile thresholds. If the [range](#quantile_range) contains *n* discrete values, the returned array will contain *n* - 1 thresholds. Values less than the first threshold are considered in the first quantile; values greater than or equal to the first threshold but less than the second threshold are in the second quantile, and so on. Internally, the thresholds array is used with [bisect](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#bisect) to find the output quantile associated with the given input value.

<a name="quantile_copy" href="#quantile_copy">#</a> <i>quantile</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/quantile.js#L44 "Source")

Returns an exact copy of this scale. Changes to this scale will not affect the returned scale, and vice versa.

### Threshold Scales

Threshold scales are similar to [quantize scales](#quantize-scales), except they allow you to map arbitrary subsets of the domain to discrete values in the range. The input domain is still continuous, and divided into slices based on a set of threshold values. See [bl.ocks.org/3306362](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3306362) for an example.

<a name="scaleThreshold" href="#scaleThreshold">#</a> d3.<b>scaleThreshold</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/threshold.js "Source")

Constructs a new threshold scale with the default [domain](#threshold_domain) [0.5] and the default [range](#threshold_range) [0, 1]. Thus, the default threshold scale is equivalent to the [Math.round](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/round) function for numbers; for example threshold(0.49) returns 0, and threshold(0.51) returns 1.

<a name="_threshold" href="#_threshold">#</a> <i>threshold</i>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/threshold.js#L4 "Source")

Given a *value* in the input [domain](#threshold_domain), returns the corresponding value in the output [range](#threshold_range). For example:

```js
var color = d3.scaleThreshold()
    .domain([0, 1])
    .range(["red", "white", "green"]);

color(-1);   // "red"
color(0);    // "white"
color(0.5);  // "white"
color(1);    // "green"
color(1000); // "green"
```

<a name="threshold_invertExtent" href="#threshold_invertExtent">#</a> <i>threshold</i>.<b>invertExtent</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/threshold.js#L21 "Source")

Returns the extent of values in the [domain](#threshold_domain) [<i>x0</i>, <i>x1</i>] for the corresponding *value* in the [range](#threshold_range), representing the inverse mapping from range to domain. This method is useful for interaction, say to determine the value in the domain that corresponds to the pixel location under the mouse. For example:

```js
var color = d3.scaleThreshold()
    .domain([0, 1])
    .range(["red", "white", "green"]);

color.invertExtent("red"); // [undefined, 0]
color.invertExtent("white"); // [0, 1]
color.invertExtent("green"); // [1, undefined]
```

<a name="threshold_domain" href="#threshold_domain">#</a> <i>threshold</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/threshold.js#L13 "Source")

If *domain* is specified, sets the scales domain to the specified array of values. The values must be in sorted ascending order, or the behavior of the scale is undefined. The values are typically numbers, but any naturally ordered values (such as strings) will work; a threshold scale can be used to encode any type that is ordered. If the number of values in the scales range is N+1, the number of values in the scales domain must be N. If there are fewer than N elements in the domain, the additional values in the range are ignored. If there are more than N elements in the domain, the scale may return undefined for some inputs. If *domain* is not specified, returns the scales current domain.

<a name="threshold_range" href="#threshold_range">#</a> <i>threshold</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/threshold.js#L17 "Source")

If *range* is specified, sets the scales range to the specified array of values. If the number of values in the scales domain is N, the number of values in the scales range must be N+1. If there are fewer than N+1 elements in the range, the scale may return undefined for some inputs. If there are more than N+1 elements in the range, the additional values are ignored. The elements in the given array need not be numbers; any value or type will work. If *range* is not specified, returns the scales current range.

<a name="threshold_copy" href="#threshold_copy">#</a> <i>threshold</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/threshold.js#L26 "Source")

Returns an exact copy of this scale. Changes to this scale will not affect the returned scale, and vice versa.

### Ordinal Scales

Unlike [continuous scales](#continuous-scales), ordinal scales have a discrete domain and range. For example, an ordinal scale might map a set of named categories to a set of colors, or determine the horizontal positions of columns in a column chart.

<a name="scaleOrdinal" href="#scaleOrdinal">#</a> d3.<b>scaleOrdinal</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/ordinal.js "Source")

Constructs a new ordinal scale with an empty [domain](#ordinal_domain) and the specified [*range*](#ordinal_range). If a *range* is not specified, it defaults to the empty array; an ordinal scale always returns undefined until a non-empty range is defined.

<a name="_ordinal" href="#_ordinal">#</a> <i>ordinal</i>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/ordinal.js#L6 "Source")

Given a *value* in the input [domain](#ordinal_domain), returns the corresponding value in the output [range](#ordinal_range). If the given *value* is not in the scales [domain](#ordinal_domain), returns the [unknown](#ordinal_value); or, if the unknown value is [implicit](#scaleImplicit) (the default), then the *value* is implicitly added to the domain and the next-available value in the range is assigned to *value*, such that this and subsequent invocations of the scale given the same input *value* return the same output value.

<a name="ordinal_domain" href="#ordinal_domain">#</a> <i>ordinal</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/ordinal.js#L22 "Source")

If *domain* is specified, sets the domain to the specified array of values. The first element in *domain* will be mapped to the first element in the range, the second domain value to the second range value, and so on. Domain values are stored internally in a map from stringified value to index; the resulting index is then used to retrieve a value from the range. Thus, an ordinal scales values must be coercible to a string, and the stringified version of the domain value uniquely identifies the corresponding range value. If *domain* is not specified, this method returns the current domain.

Setting the domain on an ordinal scale is optional if the [unknown value](#ordinal_unknown) is [implicit](#scaleImplicit) (the default). In this case, the domain will be inferred implicitly from usage by assigning each unique value passed to the scale a new value from the range. Note that an explicit domain is recommended to ensure deterministic behavior, as inferring the domain from usage will be dependent on ordering.

<a name="ordinal_range" href="#ordinal_range">#</a> <i>ordinal</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/ordinal.js#L30 "Source")

If *range* is specified, sets the range of the ordinal scale to the specified array of values. The first element in the domain will be mapped to the first element in *range*, the second domain value to the second range value, and so on. If there are fewer elements in the range than in the domain, the scale will reuse values from the start of the range. If *range* is not specified, this method returns the current range.

<a name="ordinal_unknown" href="#ordinal_unknown">#</a> <i>ordinal</i>.<b>unknown</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/ordinal.js#L34 "Source")

If *value* is specified, sets the output value of the scale for unknown input values and returns this scale. If *value* is not specified, returns the current unknown value, which defaults to [implicit](#implicit). The implicit value enables implicit domain construction; see [*ordinal*.domain](#ordinal_domain).

<a name="ordinal_copy" href="#ordinal_copy">#</a> <i>ordinal</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/ordinal.js#L38 "Source")

Returns an exact copy of this ordinal scale. Changes to this scale will not affect the returned scale, and vice versa.

<a name="scaleImplicit" href="#scaleImplicit">#</a> d3.<b>scaleImplicit</b>

A special value for [*ordinal*.unknown](#ordinal_unknown) that enables implicit domain construction: unknown values are implicitly added to the domain.

#### Band Scales

Band scales are like [ordinal scales](#ordinal-scales) except the output range is continuous and numeric. Discrete output values are automatically computed by the scale by dividing the continuous range into uniform bands. Band scales are typically used for bar charts with an ordinal or categorical dimension. The [unknown value](#ordinal_unknown) of a band scale is effectively undefined: they do not allow implicit domain construction.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-scale/master/img/band.png" width="751" height="238" alt="band">

<a name="scaleBand" href="#scaleBand">#</a> d3.<b>scaleBand</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js "Source")

Constructs a new band scale with the empty [domain](#band_domain), the unit [range](#band_range) [0, 1], no [padding](#band_padding), no [rounding](#band_round) and center [alignment](#band_align).

<a name="_band" href="#_band">#</a> <i>band</i>(*value*) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L4 "Source")

Given a *value* in the input [domain](#band_domain), returns the start of the corresponding band derived from the output [range](#band_range). If the given *value* is not in the scales domain, returns undefined.

<a name="band_domain" href="#band_domain">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L32 "Source")

If *domain* is specified, sets the domain to the specified array of values. The first element in *domain* will be mapped to the first band, the second domain value to the second band, and so on. Domain values are stored internally in a map from stringified value to index; the resulting index is then used to determine the band. Thus, a band scales values must be coercible to a string, and the stringified version of the domain value uniquely identifies the corresponding band. If *domain* is not specified, this method returns the current domain.

<a name="band_range" href="#band_range">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L36 "Source")

If *range* is specified, sets the scales range to the specified two-element array of numbers. If the elements in the given array are not numbers, they will be coerced to numbers. If *range* is not specified, returns the scales current range, which defaults to [0, 1].

<a name="band_rangeRound" href="#band_rangeRound">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>rangeRound</b>([<i>range</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L40 "Source")

Sets the scales [*range*](#band_range) to the specified two-element array of numbers while also enabling [rounding](#band_round). This is a convenience method equivalent to:

```js
band
    .range(range)
    .round(true);
```

Rounding is sometimes useful for avoiding antialiasing artifacts, though also consider the [shape-rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/shape-rendering) crispEdges styles.

<a name="band_round" href="#band_round">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>round</b>([<i>round</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L52 "Source")

If *round* is specified, enables or disables rounding accordingly. If rounding is enabled, the start and stop of each band will be integers. Rounding is sometimes useful for avoiding antialiasing artifacts, though also consider the [shape-rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/shape-rendering) crispEdges styles. Note that if the width of the domain is not a multiple of the cardinality of the range, there may be leftover unused space, even without padding! Use [*band*.align](#band_align) to specify how the leftover space is distributed.

<a name="band_paddingInner" href="#band_paddingInner">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>paddingInner</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L60 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the inner padding to the specified value which must be in the range [0, 1]. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current inner padding which defaults to 0. The inner padding determines the ratio of the range that is reserved for blank space between bands.

<a name="band_paddingOuter" href="#band_paddingOuter">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>paddingOuter</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L64 "Source")

If *padding* is specified, sets the outer padding to the specified value which must be in the range [0, 1]. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current outer padding which defaults to 0. The outer padding determines the ratio of the range that is reserved for blank space before the first band and after the last band.

<a name="band_padding" href="#band_padding">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>padding</b>([<i>padding</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L56 "Source")

A convenience method for setting the [inner](#band_paddingInner) and [outer](#band_paddingOuter) padding to the same *padding* value. If *padding* is not specified, returns the inner padding.

<a name="band_align" href="#band_align">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>align</b>([<i>align</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L68 "Source")

If *align* is specified, sets the alignment to the specified value which must be in the range [0, 1]. If *align* is not specified, returns the current alignment which defaults to 0.5. The alignment determines how any leftover unused space in the range is distributed. A value of 0.5 indicates that the leftover space should be equally distributed before the first band and after the last band; *i.e.*, the bands should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the bands to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis.

<a name="band_bandwidth" href="#band_bandwidth">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>bandwidth</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L44 "Source")

Returns the width of each band.

<a name="band_step" href="#band_step">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>step</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L48 "Source")

Returns the distance between the starts of adjacent bands.

<a name="band_copy" href="#band_copy">#</a> <i>band</i>.<b>copy</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/src/band.js#L72 "Source")

Returns an exact copy of this scale. Changes to this scale will not affect the returned scale, and vice versa.

#### Point Scales

Point scales are a variant of [band scales](#band-scales) with the bandwidth fixed to zero. Point scales are typically used for scatterplots with an ordinal or categorical dimension. The [unknown value](#ordinal_unknown) of a point scale is always undefined: they do not allow implicit domain construction.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-scale/master/img/point.png" width="648" height="155" alt="point">

<a name="scalePoint" href="#scalePoint">#</a> d3.<b>scalePoint</b>()

Constructs a new point scale with the empty [domain](#point_domain), the unit [range](#point_range) [0, 1], no [padding](#point_padding), no [rounding](#point_round) and center [alignment](#point_align).

<a name="_point" href="#_point">#</a> <i>point</i>(*value*)

Given a *value* in the input [domain](#point_domain), returns the corresponding point derived from the output [range](#point_range). If the given *value* is not in the scales domain, returns undefined.

<a name="point_domain" href="#point_domain">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>domain</b>([<i>domain</i>])

If *domain* is specified, sets the domain to the specified array of values. The first element in *domain* will be mapped to the first point, the second domain value to the second point, and so on. Domain values are stored internally in a map from stringified value to index; the resulting index is then used to determine the point. Thus, a point scales values must be coercible to a string, and the stringified version of the domain value uniquely identifies the corresponding point. If *domain* is not specified, this method returns the current domain.

<a name="point_range" href="#point_range">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>range</b>([<i>range</i>])

If *range* is specified, sets the scales range to the specified two-element array of numbers. If the elements in the given array are not numbers, they will be coerced to numbers. If *range* is not specified, returns the scales current range, which defaults to [0, 1].

<a name="point_rangeRound" href="#point_rangeRound">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>rangeRound</b>([<i>range</i>])

Sets the scales [*range*](#point_range) to the specified two-element array of numbers while also enabling [rounding](#point_round). This is a convenience method equivalent to:

```js
point
    .range(range)
    .round(true);
```

Rounding is sometimes useful for avoiding antialiasing artifacts, though also consider the [shape-rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/shape-rendering) crispEdges styles.

<a name="point_round" href="#point_round">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>round</b>([<i>round</i>])

If *round* is specified, enables or disables rounding accordingly. If rounding is enabled, the position of each point will be integers. Rounding is sometimes useful for avoiding antialiasing artifacts, though also consider the [shape-rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/shape-rendering) crispEdges styles. Note that if the width of the domain is not a multiple of the cardinality of the range, there may be leftover unused space, even without padding! Use [*point*.align](#point_align) to specify how the leftover space is distributed.

<a name="point_padding" href="#point_padding">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>padding</b>([<i>padding</i>])

If *padding* is specified, sets the outer padding to the specified value which must be in the range [0, 1]. If *padding* is not specified, returns the current outer padding which defaults to 0. The outer padding determines the ratio of the range that is reserved for blank space before the first point and after the last point. Equivalent to [*band*.paddingOuter](#band_paddingOuter).

<a name="point_align" href="#point_align">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>align</b>([<i>align</i>])

If *align* is specified, sets the alignment to the specified value which must be in the range [0, 1]. If *align* is not specified, returns the current alignment which defaults to 0.5. The alignment determines how any leftover unused space in the range is distributed. A value of 0.5 indicates that the leftover space should be equally distributed before the first point and after the last point; *i.e.*, the points should be centered within the range. A value of 0 or 1 may be used to shift the points to one side, say to position them adjacent to an axis.

<a name="point_bandwidth" href="#point_bandwidth">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>bandwidth</b>()

Returns zero.

<a name="point_step" href="#point_step">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>step</b>()

Returns the distance between the starts of adjacent points.

<a name="point_copy" href="#point_copy">#</a> <i>point</i>.<b>copy</b>()

Returns an exact copy of this scale. Changes to this scale will not affect the returned scale, and vice versa.

#### Category Scales

These color schemes are designed to work with [d3.scaleOrdinal](#scaleOrdinal). For example:

```js
var color = d3.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10);
```

For even more category scales, see [d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic).

# d3-selection

Selections allow powerful data-driven transformation of the document object model (DOM): set [attributes](#selection_attr), [styles](#selection_style), [properties](#selection_property), [HTML](#selection_html) or [text](#selection_text) content, and more. Using the [data join](#joining-data)s [enter](#selection_enter) and [exit](#selection_enter) selections, you can also [add](#selection_append) or [remove](#selection_remove) elements to correspond to data.

Selection methods typically return the current selection, or a new selection, allowing the concise application of multiple operations on a given selection via method chaining. For example, to set the class and color style of all paragraph elements in the current document:

```js
d3.selectAll("p")
    .attr("class", "graf")
    .style("color", "red");
```

This is equivalent to:

```js
var p = d3.selectAll("p");
p.attr("class", "graf");
p.style("color", "red");
```

By convention, selection methods that return the current selection use *four* spaces of indent, while methods that return a new selection use only *two*. This helps reveal changes of context by making them stick out of the chain:

```js
d3.select("body")
  .append("svg")
    .attr("width", 960)
    .attr("height", 500)
  .append("g")
    .attr("transform", "translate(20,20)")
  .append("rect")
    .attr("width", 920)
    .attr("height", 460);
```

Selections are immutable. All selection methods that affect which elements are selected (or their order) return a new selection rather than modifying the current selection. However, note that elements are necessarily mutable, as selections drive transformations of the document!

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-selection`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-selection.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var div = d3.selectAll("div");

</script>
```

[Try d3-selection in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-selection)

## API Reference

* [Modifying Elements](#modifying-elements)
* [Joining Data](#joining-data)
* [Handling Events](#handling-events)
* [Control Flow](#control-flow)
* [Local Variables](#local-variables)
* [Namespaces](#namespaces)

### Selecting Elements

Selection methods accept [W3C selector strings](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/) such as `.fancy` to select elements with the class *fancy*, or `div` to select DIV elements. Selection methods come in two forms: select and selectAll: the former selects only the first matching element, while the latter selects all matching elements in document order. The top-level selection methods, [d3.select](#select) and [d3.selectAll](#selectAll), query the entire document; the subselection methods, [*selection*.select](#selection_select) and [*selection*.selectAll](#selection_selectAll), restrict selection to descendants of the selected elements.

<a name="selection" href="#selection">#</a> d3.<b>selection</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/index.js#L38 "Source")

[Selects](#select) the root element, `document.documentElement`. This function can also be used to test for selections (`instanceof d3.selection`) or to extend the selection prototype. For example, to add a method to check checkboxes:

```js
d3.selection.prototype.checked = function(value) {
  return arguments.length < 1
      ? this.property("checked")
      : this.property("checked", !!value);
};
```

And then to use:

```js
d3.selectAll("input[type=checkbox]").checked(true);
```

<a name="select" href="#select">#</a> d3.<b>select</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/select.js#L3 "Source")

Selects the first element that matches the specified *selector* string. If no elements match the *selector*, returns an empty selection. If multiple elements match the *selector*, only the first matching element (in document order) will be selected. For example, to select the first anchor element:

```js
var anchor = d3.select("a");
```

If the *selector* is not a string, instead selects the specified node; this is useful if you already have a reference to a node, such as `this` within an event listener or a global such as `document.body`. For example, to make a clicked paragraph red:

```js
d3.selectAll("p").on("click", function() {
  d3.select(this).style("color", "red");
});
```

<a name="selectAll" href="#selectAll">#</a> d3.<b>selectAll</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selectAll.js#L3 "Source")

Selects all elements that match the specified *selector* string. The elements will be selected in document order (top-to-bottom). If no elements in the document match the *selector*, or if the *selector* is null or undefined, returns an empty selection. For example, to select all paragraphs:

```js
var paragraph = d3.selectAll("p");
```

If the *selector* is not a string, instead selects the specified array of nodes; this is useful if you already have a reference to nodes, such as `this.childNodes` within an event listener or a global such as `document.links`. The nodes may instead be a pseudo-array such as a `NodeList` or `arguments`. For example, to color all links red:

```js
d3.selectAll(document.links).style("color", "red");
```

<a name="selection_select" href="#selection_select">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>select</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/select.js "Source")

For each selected element, selects the first descendant element that matches the specified *selector* string. If no element matches the specified selector for the current element, the element at the current index will be null in the returned selection. (If the *selector* is null, every element in the returned selection will be null, resulting in an empty selection.) If the current element has associated data, this data is propagated to the corresponding selected element. If multiple elements match the selector, only the first matching element in document order is selected. For example, to select the first bold element in every paragraph:

```js
var b = d3.selectAll("p").select("b");
```

If the *selector* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). It must return an element, or null if there is no matching element. For example, to select the previous sibling of each paragraph:

```js
var previous = d3.selectAll("p").select(function() {
  return this.previousElementSibling;
});
```

Unlike [*selection*.selectAll](#selection_selectAll), *selection*.select does not affect grouping: it preserves the existing group structure and indexes, and propagates data (if any) to selected children. Grouping plays an important role in the [data join](#joining-data). See [Nested Selections](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nest/) and [How Selections Work](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/) for more on this topic.

<a name="selection_selectAll" href="#selection_selectAll">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>selectAll</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/selectAll.js "Source")

For each selected element, selects the descendant elements that match the specified *selector* string. The elements in the returned selection are grouped by their corresponding parent node in this selection. If no element matches the specified selector for the current element, or if the *selector* is null, the group at the current index will be empty. The selected elements do not inherit data from this selection; use [*selection*.data](#selection_data) to propagate data to children. For example, to select the bold elements in every paragraph:

```js
var b = d3.selectAll("p").selectAll("b");
```

If the *selector* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). It must return an array of elements (or a pseudo-array, such as a NodeList), or the empty array if there are no matching elements. For example, to select the previous and next siblings of each paragraph:

```js
var sibling = d3.selectAll("p").selectAll(function() {
  return [
    this.previousElementSibling,
    this.nextElementSibling
  ];
});
```

Unlike [*selection*.select](#selection_select), *selection*.selectAll does affect grouping: each selected descendant is grouped by the parent element in the originating selection. Grouping plays an important role in the [data join](#joining-data). See [Nested Selections](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nest/) and [How Selections Work](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/) for more on this topic.

<a name="selection_filter" href="#selection_filter">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>filter</b>(<i>filter</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/filter.js "Source")

Filters the selection, returning a new selection that contains only the elements for which the specified *filter* is true. The *filter* may be specified either as a selector string or a function. If the *filter* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]).

For example, to filter a selection of table rows to contain only even rows:

```js
var even = d3.selectAll("tr").filter(":nth-child(even)");
```

This is approximately equivalent to using [d3.selectAll](#selectAll) directly, although the indexes may be different:

```js
var even = d3.selectAll("tr:nth-child(even)");
```

Similarly, using a function:

```js
var even = d3.selectAll("tr").filter(function(d, i) { return i & 1; });
```

Or using [*selection*.select](#selection_select):

```js
var even = d3.selectAll("tr").select(function(d, i) { return i & 1 ? this : null; });
```

Note that the `:nth-child` pseudo-class is a one-based index rather than a zero-based index. Also, the above filter functions do not have precisely the same meaning as `:nth-child`; they rely on the selection index rather than the number of preceding sibling elements in the DOM.

The returned filtered selection preserves the parents of this selection, but like [*array*.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), it does not preserve indexes as some elements may be removed; use [*selection*.select](#selection_select) to preserve the index, if needed.

<a name="selection_merge" href="#selection_merge">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>merge</b>(<i>other</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/merge.js "Source")

Returns a new selection merging this selection with the specified *other* selection. The returned selection has the same number of groups and the same parents as this selection. Any missing (null) elements in this selection are filled with the corresponding element, if present (not null), from the specified *selection*. (If the *other* selection has additional groups or parents, they are ignored.)

This method is commonly used to merge the [enter](#selection_enter) and [update](#selection_data) selections after a [data-join](#joining-data). After modifying the entering and updating elements separately, you can merge the two selections and perform operations on both without duplicate code. For example:

```js
var circle = svg.selectAll("circle").data(data) // UPDATE
    .style("fill", "blue");

circle.exit().remove(); // EXIT

circle.enter().append("circle") // ENTER
    .style("fill", "green")
  .merge(circle) // ENTER + UPDATE
    .style("stroke", "black");
```

See [*selection*.data](#selection_data) for a more complete explanation of this code, which is known as the general update pattern.

This method is not intended for concatenating arbitrary selections, however: if both this selection and the specified *other* selection have (non-null) elements at the same index, this selections element is returned in the merge and the *other* selections element is ignored.

<a name="matcher" href="#matcher">#</a> d3.<b>matcher</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/matcher.js "Source")

Given the specified *selector*, returns a function which returns true if `this` element [matches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches) the specified selector. This method is used internally by [*selection*.filter](#selection_filter). For example, this:

```js
var div = selection.filter("div");
```

Is equivalent to:

```js
var div = selection.filter(d3.matcher("div"));
```

(Although D3 is not a compatibility layer, this implementation does support vendor-prefixed implementations due to the recent standardization of *element*.matches.)

<a name="selector" href="#selector">#</a> d3.<b>selector</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selector.js "Source")

Given the specified *selector*, returns a function which returns the first descendant of `this` element that matches the specified selector. This method is used internally by [*selection*.select](#selection_select). For example, this:

```js
var div = selection.select("div");
```

Is equivalent to:

```js
var div = selection.select(d3.selector("div"));
```

<a name="selectorAll" href="#selectorAll">#</a> d3.<b>selectorAll</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selectAll.js "Source")

Given the specified *selector*, returns a function which returns all descendants of `this` element that match the specified selector. This method is used internally by [*selection*.selectAll](#selection_selectAll). For example, this:

```js
var div = selection.selectAll("div");
```

Is equivalent to:

```js
var div = selection.selectAll(d3.selectorAll("div"));
```

<a name="window" href="#window">#</a> d3.<b>window</b>(<i>node</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/window.js "Source")

Returns the owner window for the specified *node*. If *node* is a node, returns the owner documents default view; if *node* is a document, returns its default view; otherwise returns the *node*.

<a name="style" href="#style">#</a> d3.<b>style</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>name</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/style.js#L32 "Source")

Returns the value of the style property with the specified *name* for the specified *node*. If the *node* has an inline style with the specified *name*, its value is returned; otherwise, the [computed property value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/computed_value) is returned. See also [*selection*.style](#selection_style).

### Modifying Elements

After selecting elements, use the selections transformation methods to affect document content. For example, to set the name attribute and color style of an anchor element:

```js
d3.select("a")
    .attr("name", "fred")
    .style("color", "red");
```

To experiment with selections, visit [d3js.org](https://d3js.org) and open your browsers developer console! (In Chrome, open the console with J.) Select elements and then inspect the returned selection to see which elements are selected and how they are grouped. Call selection methods and see how the page content changes.

<a name="selection_attr" href="#selection_attr">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>attr</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/attr.js "Source")

If a *value* is specified, sets the attribute with the specified *name* to the specified value on the selected elements and returns this selection. If the *value* is a constant, all elements are given the same attribute value; otherwise, if the *value* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The functions return value is then used to set each elements attribute. A null value will remove the specified attribute.

If a *value* is not specified, returns the current value of the specified attribute for the first (non-null) element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know that the selection contains exactly one element.

The specified *name* may have a namespace prefix, such as `xlink:href` to specify the `href` attribute in the XLink namespace. See [namespaces](#namespaces) for the map of supported namespaces; additional namespaces can be registered by adding to the map.

<a name="selection_classed" href="#selection_classed">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>classed</b>(<i>names</i>[, <i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/classed.js "Source")

If a *value* is specified, assigns or unassigns the specified CSS class *names* on the selected elements by setting the `class` attribute or modifying the `classList` property and returns this selection. The specified *names* is a string of space-separated class names. For example, to assign the classes `foo` and `bar` to the selected elements:

```js
selection.classed("foo bar", true);
```

If the *value* is truthy, then all elements are assigned the specified classes; otherwise, the classes are unassigned. If the *value* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The functions return value is then used to assign or unassign classes on each element. For example, to randomly associate the class *foo* with on average half the selected elements:

```js
selection.classed("foo", function() { return Math.random() > 0.5; });
```

If a *value* is not specified, returns true if and only if the first (non-null) selected element has the specified *classes*. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.

<a name="selection_style" href="#selection_style">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>style</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>value</i>[, <i>priority</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/style.js "Source")

If a *value* is specified, sets the style property with the specified *name* to the specified value on the selected elements and returns this selection. If the *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same style property value; otherwise, if the *value* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The functions return value is then used to set each elements style property. A null value will remove the style property. An optional *priority* may also be specified, either as null or the string `important` (without the exclamation point).

If a *value* is not specified, returns the current value of the specified style property for the first (non-null) element in the selection. The current value is defined as the elements inline value, if present, and otherwise its [computed value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/computed_value). Accessing the current style value is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.

Caution: unlike many SVG attributes, CSS styles typically have associated units. For example, `3px` is a valid stroke-width property value, while `3` is not. Some browsers implicitly assign the `px` (pixel) unit to numeric values, but not all browsers do: IE, for example, throws an invalid arguments error!

<a name="selection_property" href="#selection_property">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>property</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/property.js "Source")

Some HTML elements have special properties that are not addressable using attributes or styles, such as a form fields text `value` and a checkboxs `checked` boolean. Use this method to get or set these properties.

If a *value* is specified, sets the property with the specified *name* to the specified value on selected elements. If the *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same property value; otherwise, if the *value* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The functions return value is then used to set each elements property. A null value will delete the specified property.

If a *value* is not specified, returns the value of the specified property for the first (non-null) element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.

<a name="selection_text" href="#selection_text">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>text</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/text.js "Source")

If a *value* is specified, sets the [text content](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#Node3-textContent) to the specified value on all selected elements, replacing any existing child elements. If the *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same text content; otherwise, if the *value* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The functions return value is then used to set each elements text content. A null value will clear the content.

If a *value* is not specified, returns the text content for the first (non-null) element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.

<a name="selection_html" href="#selection_html">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>html</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/html.js "Source")

If a *value* is specified, sets the [inner HTML](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/apis-in-html-documents.html#innerhtml) to the specified value on all selected elements, replacing any existing child elements. If the *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same inner HTML; otherwise, if the *value* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The functions return value is then used to set each elements inner HTML. A null value will clear the content.

If a *value* is not specified, returns the inner HTML for the first (non-null) element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.

Use [*selection*.append](#selection_append) or [*selection*.insert](#selection_insert) instead to create data-driven content; this method is intended for when you want a little bit of HTML, say for rich formatting. Also, *selection*.html is only supported on HTML elements. SVG elements and other non-HTML elements do not support the innerHTML property, and thus are incompatible with *selection*.html. Consider using [XMLSerializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XMLSerializer) to convert a DOM subtree to text. See also the [innersvg polyfill](https://code.google.com/p/innersvg/), which provides a shim to support the innerHTML property on SVG elements.

<a name="selection_append" href="#selection_append">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>append</b>(<i>type</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/append.js "Source")

If the specified *type* is a string, appends a new element of this type (tag name) as the last child of each selected element, or before the next following sibling in the update selection if this is an [enter selection](#selection_enter). The latter behavior for enter selections allows you to insert elements into the DOM in an order consistent with the new bound data; however, note that [*selection*.order](#selection_order) may still be required if updating elements change order (*i.e.*, if the order of new data is inconsistent with old data).

If the specified *type* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). This function should return an element to be appended. (The function typically creates a new element, but it may instead return an existing element.) For example, to append a DIV element to each paragraph:

```js
d3.selectAll("p").append("div");
```

This is equivalent to:

```js
d3.selectAll("p").append(function() {
  return document.createElement("div");
});
```

Which is equivalent to:

```js
d3.selectAll("p").select(function() {
  return this.appendChild(document.createElement("div"));
});
```

In both cases, this method returns a new selection containing the appended elements. Each new element inherits the data of the current elements, if any, in the same manner as [*selection*.select](#selection_select).

The specified *name* may have a namespace prefix, such as `svg:text` to specify a `text` attribute in the SVG namespace. See [namespaces](#namespaces) for the map of supported namespaces; additional namespaces can be registered by adding to the map. If no namespace is specified, the namespace will be inherited from the parent element; or, if the name is one of the known prefixes, the corresponding namespace will be used (for example, `svg` implies `svg:svg`).

<a name="selection_insert" href="#selection_insert">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>insert</b>(<i>type</i>[, <i>before</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/insert.js "Source")

If the specified *type* is a string, inserts a new element of this type (tag name) before the first element matching the specified *before* selector for each selected element. For example, a *before* selector `:first-child` will prepend nodes before the first child. If *before* is not specified, it defaults to null. (To append elements in an order consistent with [bound data](#joining-data), use [*selection*.append](#selection_append).)

Both *type* and *before* may instead be specified as functions which are evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The *type* function should return an element to be inserted; the *before* function should return the child element before which the element should be inserted. For example, to append a DIV element to each paragraph:

```js
d3.selectAll("p").insert("div");
```

This is equivalent to:

```js
d3.selectAll("p").insert(function() {
  return document.createElement("div");
});
```

Which is equivalent to:

```js
d3.selectAll("p").select(function() {
  return this.insertBefore(document.createElement("div"), null);
});
```

In both cases, this method returns a new selection containing the appended elements. Each new element inherits the data of the current elements, if any, in the same manner as [*selection*.select](#selection_select).

The specified *name* may have a namespace prefix, such as `svg:text` to specify a `text` attribute in the SVG namespace. See [namespaces](#namespaces) for the map of supported namespaces; additional namespaces can be registered by adding to the map. If no namespace is specified, the namespace will be inherited from the parent element; or, if the name is one of the known prefixes, the corresponding namespace will be used (for example, `svg` implies `svg:svg`).

<a name="selection_remove" href="#selection_remove">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>remove</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/remove.js "Source")

Removes the selected elements from the document. Returns this selection (the removed elements) which are now detached from the DOM. There is not currently a dedicated API to add removed elements back to the document; however, you can pass a function to [*selection*.append](#selection_append) or [*selection*.insert](#selection_insert) to re-add elements.

<a name="selection_sort" href="#selection_sort">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>sort</b>(<i>compare</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/sort.js "Source")

Returns a new selection that contains a copy of each group in this selection sorted according to the *compare* function. After sorting, re-inserts elements to match the resulting order (per [*selection*.order](#selection_order)).

The compare function, which defaults to [ascending](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ascending), is passed two elements data *a* and *b* to compare. It should return either a negative, positive, or zero value. If negative, then *a* should be before *b*; if positive, then *a* should be after *b*; otherwise, *a* and *b* are considered equal and the order is arbitrary.

Note that sorting is not guaranteed to be stable; however, it is guaranteed to have the same behavior as your browsers built-in [sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) method on arrays.

<a name="selection_order" href="#selection_order">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>order</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/order.js "Source")

Re-inserts elements into the document such that the document order of each group matches the selection order. This is equivalent to calling [*selection*.sort](#selection_sort) if the data is already sorted, but much faster.

<a name="selection_raise" href="#selection_raise">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>raise</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/raise.js "Source")

Re-inserts each selected element, in order, as the last child of its parent. Equivalent to:

```js
selection.each(function() {
  this.parentNode.appendChild(this);
});
```

<a name="selection_lower" href="#selection_lower">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>lower</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/lower.js "Source")

Re-inserts each selected element, in order, as the first child of its parent. Equivalent to:

```js
selection.each(function() {
  this.parentNode.insertBefore(this, this.parentNode.firstChild);
});
```

<a name="creator" href="#creator">#</a> d3.<b>creator</b>(<i>name</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/creator.js "Source")

Given the specified element *name*, returns a function which creates an element of the given name, assuming that `this` is the parent element. This method is used internally by [*selection*.append](#selection_append) and [*selection*.insert](#selection_insert) to create new elements. For example, this:

```js
selection.append("div");
```

Is equivalent to:

```js
selection.append(d3.creator("div"));
```

See [namespace](#namespace) for details on supported namespace prefixes, such as for SVG elements.

### Joining Data

For an introduction to D3s data joins, see [Thinking With Joins](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/). Also see the [General Update Pattern](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218) examples.

<a name="selection_data" href="#selection_data">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>data</b>([<i>data</i>[, <i>key</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/data.js "Source")

Joins the specified array of *data* with the selected elements, returning a new selection that represents the *update* selection: the elements successfully bound to data. Also defines the [enter](#selection_enter) and [exit](#selection_exit) selections on the returned selection, which can be used to add or remove elements to correspond to the new data. The specified *data* is an array of arbitrary values (*e.g.*, numbers or objects), or a function that returns an array of values for each group. When data is assigned to an element, it is stored in the property `__data__`, thus making the data sticky and available on re-selection.

The *data* is specified **for each group** in the selection. If the selection has multiple groups (such as [d3.selectAll](#selectAll) followed by [*selection*.selectAll](#selection_selectAll)), then *data* should typically be specified as a function. This function will be evaluated for each group in order, being passed the groups parent datum (*d*, which may be undefined), the group index (*i*), and the selections parent nodes (*nodes*), with *this* as the groups parent element. For example, to create an HTML table from a matrix of numbers:

```js
var matrix = [
  [11975,  5871, 8916, 2868],
  [ 1951, 10048, 2060, 6171],
  [ 8010, 16145, 8090, 8045],
  [ 1013,   990,  940, 6907]
];

var tr = d3.select("body")
  .append("table")
  .selectAll("tr")
  .data(matrix)
  .enter().append("tr");

var td = tr.selectAll("td")
  .data(function(d) { return d; })
  .enter().append("td")
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
```

In this example the *data* function is the identity function: for each table row, it returns the corresponding row from the data matrix.

If a *key* function is not specified, then the first datum in *data* is assigned to the first selected element, the second datum to the second selected element, and so on. A *key* function may be specified to control which datum is assigned to which element, replacing the default join-by-index. This key function is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The key function is then also evaluated for each new datum in *data*, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the groups new *data*, with *this* as the groups parent DOM element. The datum for a given key is assigned to the element with the matching key. If multiple elements have the same key, the duplicate elements are put into the exit selection; if multiple data have the same key, the duplicate data are put into the enter selection.

For example, given this document:

```html
<div id="Ford"></div>
<div id="Jarrah"></div>
<div id="Kwon"></div>
<div id="Locke"></div>
<div id="Reyes"></div>
<div id="Shephard"></div>
```

You could join data by key as follows:


```js
var data = [
  {name: "Locke", number: 4},
  {name: "Reyes", number: 8},
  {name: "Ford", number: 15},
  {name: "Jarrah", number: 16},
  {name: "Shephard", number: 31},
  {name: "Kwon", number: 34}
];

d3.selectAll("div")
  .data(data, function(d) { return d ? d.name : this.id; })
    .text(function(d) { return d.number; });
```

This example key function uses the datum *d* if present, and otherwise falls back to the elements id property. Since these elements were not previously bound to data, the datum *d* is null when the key function is evaluated on selected elements, and non-null when the key function is evaluated on the new data.

The *update* and *enter* selections are returned in data order, while the *exit* selection preserves the selection order prior to the join. If a key function is specified, the order of elements in the selection may not match their order in the document; use [*selection*.order](#order) or [*selection*.sort](#sort) as needed. For more on how the key function affects the join, see [A Bar Chart, Part 2](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2/) and [Object Constancy](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/).

Although the data-join can be used simply to create (to *enter*) a set of elements corresponding to data, more generally the data-join is designed to let you create, destroy or update elements as needed so that the resulting DOM corresponds to the new data. The data-join lets you do this efficiently by executing only the minimum necessary operations on each state of element (entering, updating, or exiting), and allows you to declare concise animated transitions between states as well. Here is a simple example of the [General Update Pattern](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218):

```js
var circle = svg.selectAll("circle") // 1
  .data(data) // 2
    .style("fill", "blue"); // 3

circle.exit().remove(); // 4

circle.enter().append("circle") // 5
    .style("fill", "green") // 6
  .merge(circle) // 7
    .style("stroke", "black"); // 8
```

Breaking this down into discrete steps:

1. Any existing circles (that are descendants of the `svg` selection) are [selected](#selection_selectAll).
2. These circles are [joined to new `data`](#selection_data), returning the matching circles: the *update* selection.
3. These updating circles are given a blue fill.
4. Any existing circles that do *not* match new datathe *exit* selectionare removed.
5. New circles are [appended](#selection_append) for any new data that do *not* match any existing circle: the *enter* selection.
6. These entering circles are given a green fill.
7. A new selection representing the [union](#selection_merge) of entering and updating circles is created.
8. These entering and updating circles are given a black stroke.

As described in the preceding paragraphs, the matching logic is determined by the key function passed to *selection*.data; since no key function is used in the above code sample, the elements and data are joined by index.

If *data* is not specified, this method returns the array of data for the selected elements.

This method cannot be used to clear bound data; use [*selection*.datum](#selection_datum) instead.

<a name="selection_enter" href="#selection_enter">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>enter</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/enter.js "Source")

Returns the enter selection: placeholder nodes for each datum that had no corresponding DOM element in the selection. The enter selection is determined by [*selection*.data](#selection_data), and is empty on a selection that is not joined to data.

The enter selection is typically used to create missing elements corresponding to new data. For example, to create DIV elements from an array of numbers:

```js
var div = d3.select("body")
  .selectAll("div")
  .data([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42])
  .enter().append("div")
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
```

If the body is initially empty, the above code will create six new DIV elements, append them to the body in-order, and assign their text content as the associated (string-coerced) number:

```html
<div>4</div>
<div>8</div>
<div>15</div>
<div>16</div>
<div>23</div>
<div>42</div>
```

Conceptually, the enter selections placeholders are pointers to the parent element (in this example, the document body). The enter selection is typically only used transiently to append elements, and is often [merged](#selection_merge) with the update selection after appending, such that modifications can be applied to both entering and updating elements.

<a name="selection_exit" href="#selection_exit">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>exit</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/exit.js "Source")

Returns the exit selection: existing DOM elements in the selection for which no new datum was found. The exit selection is determined by the previous [*selection*.data](#selection_data), and is thus empty until the selection is joined to data. If the exit selection is retrieved more than once after a data join, subsequent calls return the empty selection.

The exit selection is typically used to remove superfluous elements corresponding to old data. For example, to update the DIV elements created previously with a new array of numbers:

```js
div = div.data([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32], function(d) { return d; });
```

Since a key function was specified (as the identity function), and the new data contains the numbers [4, 8, 16] which match existing elements in the document, the update selection contains three DIV elements. Leaving those elements as-is, we can append new elements for [1, 2, 32] using the enter selection:

```js
div.enter().append("div").text(function(d) { return d; });
```

Likewise, to remove the exiting elements [15, 23, 42]:

```js
div.exit().remove();
```

Now the document body looks like this:

```html
<div>1</div>
<div>2</div>
<div>4</div>
<div>8</div>
<div>16</div>
<div>32</div>
```

The order of the DOM elements matches the order of the data because the old datas order and the new datas order were consistent. If the new datas order is different, use [*selection*.order](#selection_order) to reorder the elements in the DOM. See the [General Update Pattern](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3808218) example thread for more on data joins.

<a name="selection_datum" href="#selection_datum">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>datum</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/datum.js "Source")

Gets or sets the bound data for each selected element. Unlike [*selection*.data](#selection_data), this method does not compute a join and does not affect indexes or the enter and exit selections.

If a *value* is specified, sets the elements bound data to the specified value on all selected elements. If the *value* is a constant, all elements are given the same datum; otherwise, if the *value* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). The function is then used to set each elements new data. A null value will delete the bound data.

If a *value* is not specified, returns the bound datum for the first (non-null) element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.

This method is useful for accessing HTML5 [custom data attributes](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute). For example, given the following elements:

```html
<ul id="list">
  <li data-username="shawnbot">Shawn Allen</li>
  <li data-username="mbostock">Mike Bostock</li>
</ul>
```

You can expose the custom data attributes by setting each elements data as the built-in [dataset](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#dom-dataset) property:

```js
selection.datum(function() { return this.dataset; })
```

### Handling Events

For interaction, selections allow listening for and dispatching of events.

<a name="selection_on" href="#selection_on">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>[, <i>listener</i>[, <i>capture</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/on.js "Source")

Adds or removes a *listener* to each selected element for the specified event *typenames*. The *typenames* is a string event type, such as `click`, `mouseover`, or `submit`; any [DOM event type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#Standard_events) supported by your browser may be used. The type may be optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a name; the optional name allows multiple callbacks to be registered to receive events of the same type, such as `click.foo` and `click.bar`. To specify multiple typenames, separate typenames with spaces, such as `input change` or `click.foo click.bar`.

When a specified event is dispatched on a selected element, the specified *listener* will be evaluated for the element, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). Listeners always see the latest datum for their element, but the index is a property of the selection and is fixed when the listener is assigned; to update the index, re-assign the listener. To access the current event within a listener, use [d3.event](#event).

If an event listener was previously registered for the same *typename* on a selected element, the old listener is removed before the new listener is added. To remove a listener, pass null as the *listener*. To remove all listeners for a given name, pass null as the *listener* and `.foo` as the *typename*, where `foo` is the name; to remove all listeners with no name, specify `.` as the *typename*.

An optional *capture* flag may be specified which corresponds to the W3C [useCapture flag](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-registration): After initiating capture, all events of the specified type will be dispatched to the registered EventListener before being dispatched to any EventTargets beneath them in the tree. Events which are bubbling upward through the tree will not trigger an EventListener designated to use capture.

If a *listener* is not specified, returns the currently-assigned listener for the specified event *typename* on the first (non-null) selected element, if any. If multiple typenames are specified, the first matching listener is returned.

<a name="selection_dispatch" href="#selection_dispatch">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>dispatch</b>(<i>type</i>[, <i>parameters</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/dispatch.js "Source")

Dispatches a [custom event](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-customevent) of the specified *type* to each selected element, in order. An optional *parameters* map may be specified to set additional properties of the event. It may contain the following fields:

* [`bubbles`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-event-bubbles) - if true, the event is dispatched to ancestors in reverse tree order.
* [`cancelable`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-event-cancelable) - if true, *event*.preventDefault is allowed.
* [`detail`](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-customevent-detail) - any custom data associated with the event.

If *parameters* is a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). It must return the parameters map for the current element.

<a name="event" href="#event">#</a> d3.<b>event</b>

The current [event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/event), if any. This is set during the invocation of an event listener, and is reset after the listener terminates. Use this to access standard event fields such as [*event*.timeStamp](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-event-timestamp) and methods such as [*event*.preventDefault](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dom-event-preventdefault). While you can use the native [*event*.pageX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.pageX) and [*event*.pageY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.pageY), it is often more convenient to transform the event position to the local coordinate system of the container that received the event using [d3.mouse](#mouse), [d3.touch](#touch) or [d3.touches](#touches).

If you use Babel, Webpack, or another ES6-to-ES5 bundler, be aware that the value of d3.event changes during an event! An import of d3.event must be a [live binding](http://www.2ality.com/2015/07/es6-module-exports.html), so you may need to configure the bundler to import from D3s ES6 modules rather than from the generated UMD bundle; not all bundlers observe [jsnext:main](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/jsnext:main). Also beware of conflicts with the [*window*.event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/event) global.

<a name="customEvent" href="#customEvent">#</a> d3.<b>customEvent</b>(<i>event</i>, <i>listener</i>[, <i>that</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/on.js#L98 "Source")

Invokes the specified *listener*, using the specified *that* `this` context and passing the specified *arguments*, if any. During the invocation, [d3.event](#event) is set to the specified *event*; after the listener returns (or throws an error), d3.event is restored to its previous value. In addition, sets *event*.sourceEvent to the prior value of d3.event, allowing custom events to retain a reference to the originating native event. Returns the value returned by the *listener*.

<a name="mouse" href="#mouse">#</a> d3.<b>mouse</b>(<i>container</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/mouse.js "Source")

Returns the *x* and *y* coordinates of the [current event](#event) relative to the specified *container*. The container may be an HTML or SVG container element, such as a [G element](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups) or an [SVG element](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElement). The coordinates are returned as a two-element array of numbers [*x*, *y*].

<a name="touch" href="#touch">#</a> d3.<b>touch</b>(<i>container</i>[, <i>touches</i>], <i>identifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/touch.js "Source")

Returns the *x* and *y* coordinates of the touch with the specified *identifier* associated with the [current event](#event) relative to the specified *container*. The container may be an HTML or SVG container element, such as a [G element](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups) or an [SVG element](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElement). The coordinates are returned as a two-element array of numbers [*x*, *y*]. If there is no touch with the specified identifier in *touches*, returns null; this can be useful for ignoring touchmove events where the only some touches have moved. If *touches* is not specified, it defaults to the current events [changedTouches](http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/TouchEventClassReference/TouchEvent/TouchEvent.html#//apple_ref/javascript/instp/TouchEvent/changedTouches) property.

<a name="touches" href="#touches">#</a> d3.<b>touches</b>(<i>container</i>[, <i>touches</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/touches.js "Source")

Returns the *x* and *y* coordinates of the touches associated with the [current event](#event) relative to the specified *container*. The container may be an HTML or SVG container element, such as a [G element](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups) or an [SVG element](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElement). The coordinates are returned as an array of two-element arrays of numbers \[\[*x1*, *y1*], [*x2*, *y2*], \]. If *touches* is not specified, it defaults to the current events [touches](http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/TouchEventClassReference/TouchEvent/TouchEvent.html#//apple_ref/javascript/instp/TouchEvent/touches) property.

### Control Flow

For advanced usage, selections provide methods for custom control flow.

<a name="selection_each" href="#selection_each">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>each</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/each.js "Source")

Invokes the specified *function* for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum (*d*), the current index (*i*), and the current group (*nodes*), with *this* as the current DOM element (*nodes*[*i*]). This method can be used to invoke arbitrary code for each selected element, and is useful for creating a context to access parent and child data simultaneously, such as:

```js
parent.each(function(p, j) {
  d3.select(this)
    .selectAll(".child")
      .text(function(d, i) { return "child " + d.name + " of " + p.name; });
});
```

See [Sized Donut Multiples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4c5fad723c87d2fd8273) for an example.

<a name="selection_call" href="#selection_call">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>call</b>(<i>function</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/call.js "Source")

Invokes the specified *function* exactly once, passing in this selection along with any optional *arguments*. Returns this selection. This is equivalent to invoking the function by hand but facilitates method chaining. For example, to set several styles in a reusable function:

```js
function name(selection, first, last) {
  selection
      .attr("first-name", first)
      .attr("last-name", last);
}
```

Now say:

```js
d3.selectAll("div").call(name, "John", "Snow");
```

This is roughly equivalent to:

```js
name(d3.selectAll("div"), "John", "Snow");
```

The only difference is that *selection*.call always returns the *selection* and not the return value of the called *function*, `name`.

<a name="selection_empty" href="#selection_empty">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>empty</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/empty.js "Source")

Returns true if this selection contains no (non-null) elements.

<a name="selection_nodes" href="#selection_nodes">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>nodes</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/nodes.js "Source")

Returns an array of all (non-null) elements in this selection.

<a name="selection_node" href="#selection_node">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>node</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/node.js "Source")

Returns the first (non-null) element in this selection. If the selection is empty, returns null.

<a name="selection_size" href="#selection_size">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>size</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/size.js "Source")

Returns the total number of elements in this selection.

### Local Variables

D3 locals allow you to define local state independent of data. For instance, when rendering [small multiples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/e1192fe405703d8321a5187350910e08) of time-series data, you might want the same *x*-scale for all charts but distinct *y*-scales to compare the relative performance of each metric. D3 locals are scoped by DOM elements: on set, the value is stored on the given element; on get, the value is retrieved from given element or the nearest ancestor that defines it.

<a name="local" href="#local">#</a> d3.<b>local</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/local.js "Source")

Declares a new local variable. For example:

```js
var foo = d3.local();
```

Like `var`, each local is a distinct symbolic reference; unlike `var`, the value of each local is also scoped by the DOM.

<a name="local_set" href="#local_set">#</a> <i>local</i>.<b>set</b>(<i>node</i>, <i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/local.js#L18 "Source")

Sets the value of this local on the specified *node* to the *value*, and returns the specified *value*. This is often performed using [*selection*.each](#selection_each):

```js
selection.each(function(d) { foo.set(this, d.value); });
```

If you are just setting a single variable, consider using [*selection*.property](#selection_property):

```js
selection.property(foo, function(d) { return d.value; });
```

<a name="local_get" href="#local_get">#</a> <i>local</i>.<b>get</b>(<i>node</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/local.js#L13 "Source")

Returns the value of this local on the specified *node*. If the *node* does not define this local, returns the value from the nearest ancestor that defines it. Returns undefined if no ancestor defines this local.

<a name="local_remove" href="#local_remove">#</a> <i>local</i>.<b>remove</b>(<i>node</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/local.js#L21 "Source")

Deletes this locals value from the specified *node*. Returns true if the *node* defined this local prior to removal, and false otherwise. If ancestors also define this local, those definitions are unaffected, and thus [*local*.get](#local_get) will still return the inherited value.

<a name="local_toString" href="#local_toString">#</a> <i>local</i>.<b>toString</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/local.js#L24 "Source")

Returns the automatically-generated identifier for this local. This is the name of the property that is used to store the locals value on elements, and thus you can also set or get the locals value using *element*[*local*] or by using [*selection*.property](#selection_property).

### Namespaces

XML namespaces are fun! Right? Fortunately you can mostly ignore them.

<a name="namespace" href="#namespace">#</a> d3.<b>namespace</b>(<i>name</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/namespace.js "Source")

Qualifies the specified *name*, which may or may not have a namespace prefix. If the name contains a colon (`:`), the substring before the colon is interpreted as the namespace prefix, which must be registered in [d3.namespaces](#namespaces). Returns an object `space` and `local` attributes describing the full namespace URL and the local name. For example:

```js
d3.namespace("svg:text"); // {space: "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", local: "text"}
```

If the name does not contain a colon, this function merely returns the input name.

<a name="namespaces" href="#namespaces">#</a> d3.<b>namespaces</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/namespaces.js "Source")

The map of registered namespace prefixes. The initial value is:

```js
{
  svg: "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",
  xhtml: "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml",
  xlink: "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink",
  xml: "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace",
  xmlns: "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/"
}
```

Additional prefixes may be assigned as needed to create elements or attributes in other namespaces.

File: ./node_modules/d3-shape/README.md
# d3-shape

Visualizations typically consist of discrete graphical marks, such as [symbols](#symbols), [arcs](#arcs), [lines](#lines) and [areas](#areas). While the rectangles of a bar chart may be easy enough to generate directly using [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) or [Canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods), other shapes are complex, such as rounded annular sectors and centripetal CatmullRom splines. This module provides a variety of shape generators for your convenience.

As with other aspects of D3, these shapes are driven by data: each shape generator exposes accessors that control how the input data are mapped to a visual representation. For example, you might define a line generator for a time series by [scaling](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) fields of your data to fit the chart:

```js
var line = d3.line()
    .x(function(d) { return x(d.date); })
    .y(function(d) { return y(d.value); });
```

This line generator can then be used to compute the `d` attribute of an SVG path element:

```js
path.datum(data).attr("d", line);
```

Or you can use it to render to a Canvas 2D context:

```js
line.context(context)(data);
```

### Arcs

[<img alt="Pie Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/pie.png" width="295" height="295">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/8878e7fd82034f1d63cf)[<img alt="Donut Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/donut.png" width="295" height="295">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2394b23da1994fc202e1)

The arc generator produces a [circular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector) or [annular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulus_\(mathematics\)) sector, as in a pie or donut chart. If the difference between the [start](#arc_startAngle) and [end](#arc_endAngle) angles (the *angular span*) is greater than [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_\(geometry\)#Tau_proposal), the arc generator will produce a complete circle or annulus. If it is less than , arcs may have [rounded corners](#arc_cornerRadius) and [angular padding](#arc_padAngle). Arcs are always centered at 0,0; use a transform (see: [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute), [Canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#transformations)) to move the arc to a different position.

See also the [pie generator](#pies), which computes the necessary angles to represent an array of data as a pie or donut chart; these angles can then be passed to an arc generator.

<a name="arc" href="#arc">#</a> d3.<b>arc</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js "Source")

Constructs a new arc generator with the default settings.

<a name="_arc" href="#_arc">#</a> <i>arc</i>(<i>arguments</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L89 "Source")

Generates an arc for the given *arguments*. The *arguments* are arbitrary; they are simply propagated to the arc generators accessor functions along with the `this` object. For example, with the default settings, an object with radii and angles is expected:

```js
var arc = d3.arc();

arc({
  innerRadius: 0,
  outerRadius: 100,
  startAngle: 0,
  endAngle: Math.PI / 2
}); // "M0,-100A100,100,0,0,1,100,0L0,0Z"
```

If the radii and angles are instead defined as constants, you can generate an arc without any arguments:

```js
var arc = d3.arc()
    .innerRadius(0)
    .outerRadius(100)
    .startAngle(0)
    .endAngle(Math.PI / 2);

arc(); // "M0,-100A100,100,0,0,1,100,0L0,0Z"
```

If the arc generator has a [context](#arc_context), then the arc is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls and this function returns void. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string is returned.

<a name="arc_centroid" href="#arc_centroid">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>centroid</b>(<i>arguments</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L224 "Source")

Computes the midpoint [*x*, *y*] of the center line of the arc that would be [generated](#_arc) by the given *arguments*. The *arguments* are arbitrary; they are simply propagated to the arc generators accessor functions along with the `this` object. To be consistent with the generated arc, the accessors must be deterministic, *i.e.*, return the same value given the same arguments. The midpoint is defined as ([startAngle](#arc_startAngle) + [endAngle](#arc_endAngle)) / 2 and ([innerRadius](#arc_innerRadius) + [outerRadius](#arc_outerRadius)) / 2. For example:

[<img alt="Circular Sector Centroids" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/centroid-circular-sector.png" width="250" height="250">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/9b5a2fd1ce1a146f27e4)[<img alt="Annular Sector Centroids" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/centroid-annular-sector.png" width="250" height="250">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c274877f647361f3df7d)

Note that this is **not the geometric center** of the arc, which may be outside the arc; this method is merely a convenience for positioning labels.

<a name="arc_innerRadius" href="#arc_innerRadius">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>innerRadius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L230 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the inner radius to the specified function or number and returns this arc generator. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current inner radius accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function innerRadius(d) {
  return d.innerRadius;
}
```

Specifying the inner radius as a function is useful for constructing a stacked polar bar chart, often in conjunction with a [sqrt scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#sqrt). More commonly, a constant inner radius is used for a donut or pie chart. If the outer radius is smaller than the inner radius, the inner and outer radii are swapped. A negative value is treated as zero.

<a name="arc_outerRadius" href="#arc_outerRadius">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>outerRadius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L234 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the outer radius to the specified function or number and returns this arc generator. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current outer radius accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function outerRadius(d) {
  return d.outerRadius;
}
```

Specifying the outer radius as a function is useful for constructing a coxcomb or polar bar chart, often in conjunction with a [sqrt scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#sqrt). More commonly, a constant outer radius is used for a pie or donut chart. If the outer radius is smaller than the inner radius, the inner and outer radii are swapped. A negative value is treated as zero.

<a name="arc_cornerRadius" href="#arc_cornerRadius">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>cornerRadius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L238 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the corner radius to the specified function or number and returns this arc generator. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current corner radius accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function cornerRadius() {
  return 0;
}
```

If the corner radius is greater than zero, the corners of the arc are rounded using circles of the given radius. For a circular sector, the two outer corners are rounded; for an annular sector, all four corners are rounded. The corner circles are shown in this diagram:

[<img alt="Rounded Circular Sectors" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/rounded-circular-sector.png" width="250" height="250">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/e5e3680f3079cf5c3437)[<img alt="Rounded Annular Sectors" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/rounded-annular-sector.png" width="250" height="250">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/f41f50e06a6c04828b6e)

The corner radius may not be larger than ([outerRadius](#arc_outerRadius) - [innerRadius](#arc_innerRadius)) / 2. In addition, for arcs whose angular span is less than , the corner radius may be reduced as two adjacent rounded corners intersect. This is occurs more often with the inner corners. See the [arc corners animation](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b7671cb38efdfa5da3af) for illustration.

<a name="arc_startAngle" href="#arc_startAngle">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>startAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L246 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the start angle to the specified function or number and returns this arc generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current start angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function startAngle(d) {
  return d.startAngle;
}
```

The *angle* is specified in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise. If |endAngle - startAngle|  , a complete circle or annulus is generated rather than a sector.

<a name="arc_endAngle" href="#arc_endAngle">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>endAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L250 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the end angle to the specified function or number and returns this arc generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current end angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function endAngle(d) {
  return d.endAngle;
}
```

The *angle* is specified in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise. If |endAngle - startAngle|  , a complete circle or annulus is generated rather than a sector.

<a name="arc_padAngle" href="#arc_padAngle">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>padAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L254 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the pad angle to the specified function or number and returns this arc generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current pad angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function padAngle() {
  return d && d.padAngle;
}
```

The pad angle is converted to a fixed linear distance separating adjacent arcs, defined as [padRadius](#arc_padRadius) * padAngle. This distance is subtracted equally from the [start](#arc_startAngle) and [end](#arc_endAngle) of the arc. If the arc forms a complete circle or annulus, as when |endAngle - startAngle|  , the pad angle is ignored.

If the [inner radius](#arc_innerRadius) or angular span is small relative to the pad angle, it may not be possible to maintain parallel edges between adjacent arcs. In this case, the inner edge of the arc may collapse to a point, similar to a circular sector. For this reason, padding is typically only applied to annular sectors (*i.e.*, when innerRadius is positive), as shown in this diagram:

[<img alt="Padded Circular Sectors" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/padded-circular-sector.png" width="250" height="250">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/f37b07b92633781a46f7)[<img alt="Padded Annular Sectors" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/padded-annular-sector.png" width="250" height="250">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/99f0a6533f7c949cf8b8)

The recommended minimum inner radius when using padding is outerRadius \* padAngle / sin(), where  is the angular span of the smallest arc before padding. For example, if the outer radius is 200 pixels and the pad angle is 0.02 radians, a reasonable  is 0.04 radians, and a reasonable inner radius is 100 pixels. See the [arc padding animation](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/053fcc2295a445afab07) for illustration.

Often, the pad angle is not set directly on the arc generator, but is instead computed by the [pie generator](#pies) so as to ensure that the area of padded arcs is proportional to their value; see [*pie*.padAngle](#pie_padAngle). See the [pie padding animation](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3e961b4c97a1b543fff2) for illustration. If you apply a constant pad angle to the arc generator directly, it tends to subtract disproportionately from smaller arcs, introducing distortion.

<a name="arc_padRadius" href="#arc_padRadius">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>padRadius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L242 "Source")

If *radius* is specified, sets the pad radius to the specified function or number and returns this arc generator. If *radius* is not specified, returns the current pad radius accessor, which defaults to null, indicating that the pad radius should be automatically computed as sqrt([innerRadius](#arc_innerRadius) * innerRadius + [outerRadius](#arc_outerRadius) * outerRadius). The pad radius determines the fixed linear distance separating adjacent arcs, defined as padRadius * [padAngle](#arc_padAngle).

<a name="arc_context" href="#arc_context">#</a> <i>arc</i>.<b>context</b>([<i>context</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/arc.js#L258 "Source")

If *context* is specified, sets the context and returns this arc generator. If *context* is not specified, returns the current context, which defaults to null. If the context is not null, then the [generated arc](#_arc) is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string representing the generated arc is returned.

### Pies

The pie generator does not produce a shape directly, but instead computes the necessary angles to represent a tabular dataset as a pie or donut chart; these angles can then be passed to an [arc generator](#arcs).

<a name="pie" href="#pie">#</a> d3.<b>pie</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js "Source")

Constructs a new pie generator with the default settings.

<a name="_pie" href="#_pie">#</a> <i>pie</i>(<i>data</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js#L14 "Source")

Generates a pie for the given array of *data*, returning an array of objects representing each datums arc angles. Any additional *arguments* are arbitrary; they are simply propagated to the pie generators accessor functions along with the `this` object. The length of the returned array is the same as *data*, and each element *i* in the returned array corresponds to the element *i* in the input data. Each object in the returned array has the following properties:

* `data` - the input datum; the corresponding element in the input data array.
* `value` - the numeric [value](#pie_value) of the arc.
* `index` - the zero-based [sorted index](#pie_sort) of the arc.
* `startAngle` - the [start angle](#pie_startAngle) of the arc.
* `endAngle` - the [end angle](#pie_endAngle) of the arc.
* `padAngle` - the [pad angle](#pie_padAngle) of the arc.

This representation is designed to work with the arc generators default [startAngle](#arc_startAngle), [endAngle](#arc_endAngle) and [padAngle](#arc_padAngle) accessors. The angular units are arbitrary, but if you plan to use the pie generator in conjunction with an [arc generator](#arcs), you should specify angles in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise.

Given a small dataset of numbers, here is how to compute the arc angles to render this data as a pie chart:

```js
var data = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21];
var arcs = d3.pie()(data);
```

The first pair of parens, `pie()`, [constructs](#pie) a default pie generator. The second, `pie()(data)`, [invokes](#_pie) this generator on the dataset, returning an array of objects:

```json
[
  {"data":  1, "value":  1, "index": 6, "startAngle": 6.050474740247008, "endAngle": 6.166830023713296, "padAngle": 0},
  {"data":  1, "value":  1, "index": 7, "startAngle": 6.166830023713296, "endAngle": 6.283185307179584, "padAngle": 0},
  {"data":  2, "value":  2, "index": 5, "startAngle": 5.817764173314431, "endAngle": 6.050474740247008, "padAngle": 0},
  {"data":  3, "value":  3, "index": 4, "startAngle": 5.468698322915565, "endAngle": 5.817764173314431, "padAngle": 0},
  {"data":  5, "value":  5, "index": 3, "startAngle": 4.886921905584122, "endAngle": 5.468698322915565, "padAngle": 0},
  {"data":  8, "value":  8, "index": 2, "startAngle": 3.956079637853813, "endAngle": 4.886921905584122, "padAngle": 0},
  {"data": 13, "value": 13, "index": 1, "startAngle": 2.443460952792061, "endAngle": 3.956079637853813, "padAngle": 0},
  {"data": 21, "value": 21, "index": 0, "startAngle": 0.000000000000000, "endAngle": 2.443460952792061, "padAngle": 0}
]
```

Note that the returned array is in the same order as the data, even though this pie chart is [sorted](#pie_sortValues) by descending value, starting with the arc for the last datum (value 21) at 12 oclock.

<a name="pie_value" href="#pie_value">#</a> <i>pie</i>.<b>value</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js#L54 "Source")

If *value* is specified, sets the value accessor to the specified function or number and returns this pie generator. If *value* is not specified, returns the current value accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function value(d) {
  return d;
}
```

When a pie is [generated](#_pie), the value accessor will be invoked for each element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. The default value accessor assumes that the input data are numbers, or that they are coercible to numbers using [valueOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/valueOf). If your data are not simply numbers, then you should specify an accessor that returns the corresponding numeric value for a given datum. For example:

```js
var data = [
  {"number":  4, "name": "Locke"},
  {"number":  8, "name": "Reyes"},
  {"number": 15, "name": "Ford"},
  {"number": 16, "name": "Jarrah"},
  {"number": 23, "name": "Shephard"},
  {"number": 42, "name": "Kwon"}
];

var arcs = d3.pie()
    .value(function(d) { return d.number; })
    (data);
```

This is similar to [mapping](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) your data to values before invoking the pie generator:

```js
var arcs = d3.pie()(data.map(function(d) { return d.number; }));
```

The benefit of an accessor is that the input data remains associated with the returned objects, thereby making it easier to access other fields of the data, for example to set the color or to add text labels.

<a name="pie_sort" href="#pie_sort">#</a> <i>pie</i>.<b>sort</b>([<i>compare</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js#L62 "Source")

If *compare* is specified, sets the data comparator to the specified function and returns this pie generator. If *compare* is not specified, returns the current data comparator, which defaults to null. If both the data comparator and the value comparator are null, then arcs are positioned in the original input order. Otherwise, the data is sorted according to the data comparator, and the resulting order is used. Setting the data comparator implicitly sets the [value comparator](#pie_sortValues) to null.

The *compare* function takes two arguments *a* and *b*, each elements from the input data array. If the arc for *a* should be before the arc for *b*, then the comparator must return a number less than zero; if the arc for *a* should be after the arc for *b*, then the comparator must return a number greater than zero; returning zero means that the relative order of *a* and *b* is unspecified. For example, to sort arcs by their associated name:

```js
pie.sort(function(a, b) { return a.name.localeCompare(b.name); });
```

Sorting does not affect the order of the [generated arc array](#_pie) which is always in the same order as the input data array; it merely affects the computed angles of each arc. The first arc starts at the [start angle](#pie_startAngle) and the last arc ends at the [end angle](#pie_endAngle).

<a name="pie_sortValues" href="#pie_sortValues">#</a> <i>pie</i>.<b>sortValues</b>([<i>compare</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js#L58 "Source")

If *compare* is specified, sets the value comparator to the specified function and returns this pie generator. If *compare* is not specified, returns the current value comparator, which defaults to descending value. The default value comparator is implemented as:

```js
function compare(a, b) {
  return b - a;
}
```

If both the data comparator and the value comparator are null, then arcs are positioned in the original input order. Otherwise, the data is sorted according to the data comparator, and the resulting order is used. Setting the value comparator implicitly sets the [data comparator](#pie_sort) to null.

The value comparator is similar to the [data comparator](#pie_sort), except the two arguments *a* and *b* are values derived from the input data array using the [value accessor](#pie_value), not the data elements. If the arc for *a* should be before the arc for *b*, then the comparator must return a number less than zero; if the arc for *a* should be after the arc for *b*, then the comparator must return a number greater than zero; returning zero means that the relative order of *a* and *b* is unspecified. For example, to sort arcs by ascending value:

```js
pie.sortValues(function(a, b) { return a - b; });
```

Sorting does not affect the order of the [generated arc array](#_pie) which is always in the same order as the input data array; it merely affects the computed angles of each arc. The first arc starts at the [start angle](#pie_startAngle) and the last arc ends at the [end angle](#pie_endAngle).

<a name="pie_startAngle" href="#pie_startAngle">#</a> <i>pie</i>.<b>startAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js#L66 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the overall start angle of the pie to the specified function or number and returns this pie generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current start angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function startAngle() {
  return 0;
}
```

The start angle here means the *overall* start angle of the pie, *i.e.*, the start angle of the first arc. The start angle accessor is invoked once, being passed the same arguments and `this` context as the [pie generator](#_pie). The units of *angle* are arbitrary, but if you plan to use the pie generator in conjunction with an [arc generator](#arcs), you should specify an angle in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise.

<a name="pie_endAngle" href="#pie_endAngle">#</a> <i>pie</i>.<b>endAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js#L70 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the overall end angle of the pie to the specified function or number and returns this pie generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current end angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function endAngle() {
  return 2 * Math.PI;
}
```

The end angle here means the *overall* end angle of the pie, *i.e.*, the end angle of the last arc. The end angle accessor is invoked once, being passed the same arguments and `this` context as the [pie generator](#_pie). The units of *angle* are arbitrary, but if you plan to use the pie generator in conjunction with an [arc generator](#arcs), you should specify an angle in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise.

The value of the end angle is constrained to [startAngle](#pie_startAngle) , such that |endAngle - startAngle|  .

<a name="pie_padAngle" href="#pie_padAngle">#</a> <i>pie</i>.<b>padAngle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pie.js#L74 "Source")

If *angle* is specified, sets the pad angle to the specified function or number and returns this pie generator. If *angle* is not specified, returns the current pad angle accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function padAngle() {
  return 0;
}
```

The pad angle here means the angular separation between each adjacent arc. The total amount of padding reserved is the specified *angle* times the number of elements in the input data array, and at most |endAngle - startAngle|; the remaining space is then divided proportionally by [value](#pie_value) such that the relative area of each arc is preserved. See the [pie padding animation](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3e961b4c97a1b543fff2) for illustration. The pad angle accessor is invoked once, being passed the same arguments and `this` context as the [pie generator](#_pie). The units of *angle* are arbitrary, but if you plan to use the pie generator in conjunction with an [arc generator](#arcs), you should specify an angle in radians.

### Lines

[<img width="295" height="154" alt="Line Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/line.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1550e57e12e73b86ad9e)

The line generator produces a [spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_\(mathematics\)) or [polyline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_chain), as in a line chart. Lines also appear in many other visualization types, such as the links in [hierarchical edge bundling](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607999).

<a name="line" href="#line">#</a> d3.<b>line</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/line.js "Source")

Constructs a new line generator with the default settings.

<a name="_line" href="#_line">#</a> <i>line</i>(<i>data</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/line.js#L14 "Source")

Generates a line for the given array of *data*. Depending on this line generators associated [curve](#line_curve), the given input *data* may need to be sorted by *x*-value before being passed to the line generator. If the line generator has a [context](#line_context), then the line is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls and this function returns void. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string is returned.

<a name="line_x" href="#line_x">#</a> <i>line</i>.<b>x</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/line.js#L34 "Source")

If *x* is specified, sets the x accessor to the specified function or number and returns this line generator. If *x* is not specified, returns the current x accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function x(d) {
  return d[0];
}
```

When a line is [generated](#_line), the x accessor will be invoked for each [defined](#line_defined) element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. The default x accessor assumes that the input data are two-element arrays of numbers. If your data are in a different format, or if you wish to transform the data before rendering, then you should specify a custom accessor. For example, if `x` is a [time scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#time-scales) and `y` is a [linear scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#linear-scales):

```js
var data = [
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 24), value: 93.24},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 25), value: 95.35},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 26), value: 98.84},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 27), value: 99.92},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 30), value: 99.80},
  {date: new Date(2007, 4,  1), value: 99.47},
  
];

var line = d3.line()
    .x(function(d) { return x(d.date); })
    .y(function(d) { return y(d.value); });
```

<a name="line_y" href="#line_y">#</a> <i>line</i>.<b>y</b>([<i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/line.js#L38 "Source")

If *y* is specified, sets the y accessor to the specified function or number and returns this line generator. If *y* is not specified, returns the current y accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function y(d) {
  return d[1];
}
```

When a line is [generated](#_line), the y accessor will be invoked for each [defined](#line_defined) element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. The default y accessor assumes that the input data are two-element arrays of numbers. See [*line*.x](#line_x) for more information.

<a name="line_defined" href="#line_defined">#</a> <i>line</i>.<b>defined</b>([<i>defined</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/line.js#L42 "Source")

If *defined* is specified, sets the defined accessor to the specified function or boolean and returns this line generator. If *defined* is not specified, returns the current defined accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function defined() {
  return true;
}
```

The default accessor thus assumes that the input data is always defined. When a line is [generated](#_line), the defined accessor will be invoked for each element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. If the given element is defined (*i.e.*, if the defined accessor returns a truthy value for this element), the [x](#line_x) and [y](#line_y) accessors will subsequently be evaluated and the point will be added to the current line segment. Otherwise, the element will be skipped, the current line segment will be ended, and a new line segment will be generated for the next defined point. As a result, the generated line may have several discrete segments. For example:

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/line-defined.png" width="480" height="250" alt="Line with Missing Data">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/0533f44f2cfabecc5e3a)

Note that if a line segment consists of only a single point, it may appear invisible unless rendered with rounded or square [line caps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-linecap). In addition, some curves such as [curveCardinalOpen](#curveCardinalOpen) only render a visible segment if it contains multiple points.

<a name="line_curve" href="#line_curve">#</a> <i>line</i>.<b>curve</b>([<i>curve</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/line.js#L46 "Source")

If *curve* is specified, sets the [curve factory](#curves) and returns this line generator. If *curve* is not specified, returns the current curve factory, which defaults to [curveLinear](#curveLinear).

<a name="line_context" href="#line_context">#</a> <i>line</i>.<b>context</b>([<i>context</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/line.js#L50 "Source")

If *context* is specified, sets the context and returns this line generator. If *context* is not specified, returns the current context, which defaults to null. If the context is not null, then the [generated line](#_line) is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string representing the generated line is returned.

<a name="lineRadial" href="#lineRadial">#</a> d3.<b>lineRadial</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/lineRadial.js "Source")

<img alt="Radial Line" width="250" height="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/line-radial.png">

Constructs a new radial line generator with the default settings. A radial line generator is equivalent to the standard Cartesian [line generator](#line), except the [x](#line_x) and [y](#line_y) accessors are replaced with [angle](#lineRadial_angle) and [radius](#lineRadial_radius) accessors. Radial lines are always positioned relative to 0,0; use a transform (see: [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute), [Canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#transformations)) to change the origin.

<a name="_lineRadial" href="#_lineRadial">#</a> <i>lineRadial</i>(<i>data</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/lineRadial.js#L4 "Source")

Equivalent to [*line*.x](#line_x), except the accessor returns the angle in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock).

<a name="lineRadial_radius" href="#lineRadial_radius">#</a> <i>lineRadial</i>.<b>radius</b>([<i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/lineRadial.js#L8 "Source")

Equivalent to [*line*.curve](#line_curve). Note that [curveMonotoneX](#curveMonotoneX) or [curveMonotoneY](#curveMonotoneY) are not recommended for radial lines because they assume that the data is monotonic in *x* or *y*, which is typically untrue of radial lines.

<a name="lineRadial_context" href="#lineRadial_context">#</a> <i>lineRadial</i>.<b>context</b>([<i>context</i>])

### Areas

[<img alt="Area Chart" width="295" height="154" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/area.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883195)[<img alt="Stacked Area Chart" width="295" height="154" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/area-stacked.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885211)[<img alt="Difference Chart" width="295" height="154" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/area-difference.png">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3894205)

The area generator produces an area, as in an area chart. An area is defined by two bounding [lines](#lines), either splines or polylines. Typically, the two lines share the same [*x*-values](#area_x) ([x0](#area_x0) = [x1](#area_x1)), differing only in *y*-value ([y0](#area_y0) and [y1](#area_y1)); most commonly, y0 is defined as a constant representing [zero](http://www.vox.com/2015/11/19/9758062/y-axis-zero-chart). The first line (the <i>topline</i>) is defined by x1 and y1 and is rendered first; the second line (the <i>baseline</i>) is defined by x0 and y0 and is rendered second, with the points in reverse order. With a [curveLinear](#curveLinear) [curve](#area_curve), this produces a clockwise polygon.

<a name="_area" href="#_area">#</a> <i>area</i>(<i>data</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L17 "Source")

Generates an area for the given array of *data*. Depending on this area generators associated [curve](#area_curve), the given input *data* may need to be sorted by *x*-value before being passed to the area generator. If the area generator has a [context](#line_context), then the area is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls and this function returns void. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string is returned.

<a name="area_x" href="#area_x">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>x</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L59 "Source")

If *x* is specified, sets [x0](#area_x0) to *x* and [x1](#area_x1) to null and returns this area generator. If *x* is not specified, returns the current x0 accessor.

<a name="area_x0" href="#area_x0">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>x0</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L63 "Source")

If *x* is specified, sets the x0 accessor to the specified function or number and returns this area generator. If *x* is not specified, returns the current x0 accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function x(d) {
  return d[0];
}
```

When an area is [generated](#_area), the x0 accessor will be invoked for each [defined](#area_defined) element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. The default x0 accessor assumes that the input data are two-element arrays of numbers. If your data are in a different format, or if you wish to transform the data before rendering, then you should specify a custom accessor. For example, if `x` is a [time scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#time-scales) and `y` is a [linear scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#linear-scales):

```js
var data = [
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 24), value: 93.24},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 25), value: 95.35},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 26), value: 98.84},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 27), value: 99.92},
  {date: new Date(2007, 3, 30), value: 99.80},
  {date: new Date(2007, 4,  1), value: 99.47},
  
];

var area = d3.area()
    .x(function(d) { return x(d.date); })
    .y1(function(d) { return y(d.value); })
    .y0(y(0));
```

<a name="area_x1" href="#area_x1">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>x1</b>([<i>x</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L67 "Source")

If *x* is specified, sets the x1 accessor to the specified function or number and returns this area generator. If *x* is not specified, returns the current x1 accessor, which defaults to null, indicating that the previously-computed [x0](#area_x0) value should be reused for the x1 value.

When an area is [generated](#_area), the x1 accessor will be invoked for each [defined](#area_defined) element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. See [*area*.x0](#area_x0) for more information.

<a name="area_y" href="#area_y">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>y</b>([<i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L71 "Source")

If *y* is specified, sets [y0](#area_y0) to *y* and [y1](#area_y1) to null and returns this area generator. If *y* is not specified, returns the current y0 accessor.

<a name="area_y0" href="#area_y0">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>y0</b>([<i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L75 "Source")

If *y* is specified, sets the y0 accessor to the specified function or number and returns this area generator. If *y* is not specified, returns the current y0 accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function y() {
  return 0;
}
```

When an area is [generated](#_area), the y0 accessor will be invoked for each [defined](#area_defined) element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. See [*area*.x0](#area_x0) for more information.

<a name="area_y1" href="#area_y1">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>y1</b>([<i>y</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L79 "Source")

If *y* is specified, sets the y1 accessor to the specified function or number and returns this area generator. If *y* is not specified, returns the current y1 accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function y(d) {
  return d[1];
}
```

A null accessor is also allowed, indicating that the previously-computed [y0](#area_y0) value should be reused for the y1 value. When an area is [generated](#_area), the y1 accessor will be invoked for each [defined](#area_defined) element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. See [*area*.x0](#area_x0) for more information.

<a name="area_defined" href="#area_defined">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>defined</b>([<i>defined</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L96 "Source")

If *defined* is specified, sets the defined accessor to the specified function or boolean and returns this area generator. If *defined* is not specified, returns the current defined accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function defined() {
  return true;
}
```

The default accessor thus assumes that the input data is always defined. When an area is [generated](#_area), the defined accessor will be invoked for each element in the input data array, being passed the element `d`, the index `i`, and the array `data` as three arguments. If the given element is defined (*i.e.*, if the defined accessor returns a truthy value for this element), the [x0](#area_x0), [x1](#area_x1), [y0](#area_y0) and [y1](#area_y1) accessors will subsequently be evaluated and the point will be added to the current area segment. Otherwise, the element will be skipped, the current area segment will be ended, and a new area segment will be generated for the next defined point. As a result, the generated area may have several discrete segments. For example:

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/area-defined.png" width="480" height="250" alt="Area with Missing Data">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3035090)

Note that if an area segment consists of only a single point, it may appear invisible unless rendered with rounded or square [line caps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-linecap). In addition, some curves such as [curveCardinalOpen](#curveCardinalOpen) only render a visible segment if it contains multiple points.

<a name="area_curve" href="#area_curve">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>curve</b>([<i>curve</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L100 "Source")

If *curve* is specified, sets the [curve factory](#curves) and returns this area generator. If *curve* is not specified, returns the current curve factory, which defaults to [curveLinear](#curveLinear).

<a name="area_context" href="#area_context">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>context</b>([<i>context</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L104 "Source")

If *context* is specified, sets the context and returns this area generator. If *context* is not specified, returns the current context, which defaults to null. If the context is not null, then the [generated area](#_area) is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string representing the generated area is returned.

<a name="area_lineX0" href="#area_lineX0">#</a> <i>area</i>.<b>lineX0</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/area.js#L83 "Source")

<img alt="Radial Area" width="250" height="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/area-radial.png">

Constructs a new radial area generator with the default settings. A radial area generator is equivalent to the standard Cartesian [area generator](#area), except the [x](#area_x) and [y](#area_y) accessors are replaced with [angle](#areaRadial_angle) and [radius](#areaRadial_radius) accessors. Radial areas are always positioned relative to 0,0; use a transform (see: [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute), [Canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#transformations)) to change the origin.

### Curves

While [lines](#lines) are defined as a sequence of two-dimensional [*x*, *y*] points, and [areas](#areas) are similarly defined by a topline and a baseline, there remains the task of transforming this discrete representation into a continuous shape: *i.e.*, how to interpolate between the points. A variety of curves are provided for this purpose.

Curves are typically not constructed or used directly, instead being passed to [*line*.curve](#line_curve) and [*area*.curve](#area_curve). For example:

```js
var line = d3.line()
    .x(function(d) { return x(d.date); })
    .y(function(d) { return y(d.value); })
    .curve(d3.curveCatmullRom.alpha(0.5));
```

Produces a cubic [basis spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) using the specified control points. The first and last points are triplicated such that the spline starts at the first point and ends at the last point, and is tangent to the line between the first and second points, and to the line between the penultimate and last points.

### Custom Curves

Curves are typically not used directly, instead being passed to [*line*.curve](#line_curve) and [*area*.curve](#area_curve). However, you can define your own curve implementation should none of the built-in curves satisfy your needs using the following interface. You can also use this low-level interface with a built-in curve type as an alternative to the line and area generators.

<a name="curve_areaStart" href="#curve_areaStart">#</a> <i>curve</i>.<b>areaStart</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/curve/step.js#L7 "Source")

Indicates the start of a new area segment. Each area segment consists of exactly two [line segments](#curve_lineStart): the topline, followed by the baseline, with the baseline points in reverse order.

<a name="curve_areaEnd" href="#curve_areaEnd">#</a> <i>curve</i>.<b>areaEnd</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/curve/step.js#L10 "Source")

Indicates the end of the current area segment.

<a name="curve_lineStart" href="#curve_lineStart">#</a> <i>curve</i>.<b>lineStart</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/curve/step.js#L13 "Source")

<a name="curve_point" href="#curve_point">#</a> <i>curve</i>.<b>point</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/curve/step.js#L22 "Source")

Indicates a new point in the current line segment with the given *x*- and *y*-values.

### Links

The **link** shape generates a smooth cubic Bzier curve from a source point to a target point. The tangents of the curve at the start and end are either [vertical](#linkVertical), [horizontal](#linkHorizontal) or [radial](#linkRadial).

<a name="linkVertical" href="#linkVertical">#</a> d3.<b>linkVertical</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/link/index.js#L74 "Source")

Returns a new [link generator](#_link) with vertical tangents. For example, to visualize [links](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_links) in a [tree diagram](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#tree) rooted on the top edge of the display, you might say:

    .y(function(d) { return d.y; });
```

<a name="linkHorizontal" href="#linkHorizontal">#</a> d3.<b>linkHorizontal</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/link/index.js#L70 "Source")

Returns a new [link generator](#_link) with horizontal tangents. For example, to visualize [links](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_links) in a [tree diagram](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#tree) rooted on the left edge of the display, you might say:

```js
var link = d3.linkHorizontal()
    .x(function(d) { return d.y; })
    .y(function(d) { return d.x; });
```

<a href="#_link" name="_link">#</a> <i>link</i>(<i>arguments</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/link/index.js#L21 "Source")

Generates a link for the given *arguments*. The *arguments* are arbitrary; they are simply propagated to the link generators accessor functions along with the `this` object. For example, with the default settings, an object expected:

```js
link({
  source: [100, 100],
  target: [300, 300]
});
```

<a name="link_source" href="#link_source">#</a> <i>link</i>.<b>source</b>([<i>source</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/link/index.js#L28 "Source")

If *source* is specified, sets the source accessor to the specified function and returns this link generator. If *source* is not specified, returns the current source accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function source(d) {
  return d.source;
}
```

<a name="link_target" href="#link_target">#</a> <i>link</i>.<b>target</b>([<i>target</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/link/index.js#L32 "Source")

If *target* is specified, sets the target accessor to the specified function and returns this link generator. If *target* is not specified, returns the current target accessor, which defaults to:

  return d.target;
}
```

If *context* is specified, sets the context and returns this link generator. If *context* is not specified, returns the current context, which defaults to null. If the context is not null, then the [generated link](#_link) is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string representing the generated link is returned. See also [d3-path](https://github.com/d3/d3-path).

<a name="linkRadial" href="#linkRadial">#</a> d3.<b>linkRadial</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/link/index.js#L78 "Source")

Returns a new [link generator](#_link) with radial tangents. For example, to visualize [links](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#node_links) in a [tree diagram](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#tree) rooted in the center of the display, you might say:

```js
var link = d3.linkRadial()
    .angle(function(d) { return d.x; })
    .radius(function(d) { return d.y; });
```

<a name="linkRadial_angle" href="#linkRadial_angle">#</a> <i>linkRadial</i>.<b>angle</b>([<i>angle</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/link/index.js#L80 "Source")

Equivalent to [*link*.y](#link_y), except the accessor returns the radius: the distance from the origin 0,0.

### Symbols

<a href="#symbolCircle"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/circle.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolCross"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/cross.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolDiamond"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/diamond.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolSquare"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/square.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolStar"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/star.png" width="100" height="100"></a><a href="#symbolTriangle"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/triangle.png" width="100" height="100"><a href="#symbolWye"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/wye.png" width="100" height="100"></a>

Symbols provide a categorical shape encoding as is commonly used in scatterplots. Symbols are always centered at 0,0; use a transform (see: [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute), [Canvas](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#transformations)) to move the symbol to a different position.

<a name="symbol" href="#symbol">#</a> d3.<b>symbol</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol.js "Source")

Constructs a new symbol generator with the default settings.

<a name="_symbol" href="#_symbol">#</a> <i>symbol</i>(<i>arguments</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol.js#L11 "Source")

Generates a symbol for the given *arguments*. The *arguments* are arbitrary; they are simply propagated to the symbol generators accessor functions along with the `this` object. For example, with the default settings, no arguments are needed to produce a circle with area 64 square pixels. If the symbol generator has a [context](#symbol_context), then the symbol is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls and this function returns void. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string is returned.

<a name="symbol_type" href="#symbol_type">#</a> <i>symbol</i>.<b>type</b>([<i>type</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol.js#L33 "Source")

If *type* is specified, sets the symbol type to the specified function or symbol type and returns this line generator. If *type* is not specified, returns the current symbol type accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function type() {
  return circle;
}
```

See [symbols](#symbols) for the set of built-in symbol types. To implement a custom symbol type, pass an object that implements [*symbolType*.draw](#symbolType_draw).

<a name="symbol_size" href="#symbol_size">#</a> <i>symbol</i>.<b>size</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol.js#L37 "Source")

If *size* is specified, sets the size to the specified function or number and returns this symbol generator. If *size* is not specified, returns the current size accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function size() {
  return 64;
}
```

Specifying the size as a function is useful for constructing a scatterplot with a size encoding. If you wish to scale the symbol to fit a given bounding box, rather than by area, try [SVGs getBBox](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3dd515e692504c92ab65).

<a name="symbol_context" href="#symbol_context">#</a> <i>symbol</i>.<b>context</b>([<i>context</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol.js#L41 "Source")

If *context* is specified, sets the context and returns this symbol generator. If *context* is not specified, returns the current context, which defaults to null. If the context is not null, then the [generated symbol](#_symbol) is rendered to this context as a sequence of [path method](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) calls. Otherwise, a [path data](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) string representing the generated symbol is returned.

<a name="symbols" href="#symbols">#</a> d3.<b>symbols</b>

An array containing the set of all built-in symbol types: [circle](#symbolCircle), [cross](#symbolCross), [diamond](#symbolDiamond), [square](#symbolSquare), [star](#symbolStar), [triangle](#symbolTriangle), and [wye](#symbolWye). Useful for constructing the range of an [ordinal scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#ordinal-scales) should you wish to use a shape encoding for categorical data.

<a name="symbolCircle" href="#symbolCircle">#</a> d3.<b>symbolCircle</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol/circle.js "Source")

The circle symbol type.

<a name="symbolCross" href="#symbolCross">#</a> d3.<b>symbolCross</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol/cross.js "Source")

The Greek cross symbol type, with arms of equal length.

<a name="symbolDiamond" href="#symbolDiamond">#</a> d3.<b>symbolDiamond</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol/diamond.js "Source")

<a name="symbolTriangle" href="#symbolTriangle">#</a> d3.<b>symbolTriangle</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol/triangle.js "Source")

The up-pointing triangle symbol type.

<a name="symbolWye" href="#symbolWye">#</a> d3.<b>symbolWye</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/symbol/wye.js "Source")

The Y-shape symbol type.

<a name="pointRadial" href="#pointRadial">#</a> d3.<b>pointRadial</b>(<i>angle</i>, <i>radius</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/pointRadial.js "Source")

Returns the point [<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>] for the given *angle* in radians, with 0 at -*y* (12 oclock) and positive angles proceeding clockwise, and the given *radius*.

### Custom Symbol Types

Symbol types are typically not used directly, instead being passed to [*symbol*.type](#symbol_type). However, you can define your own symbol type implementation should none of the built-in types satisfy your needs using the following interface. You can also use this low-level interface with a built-in symbol type as an alternative to the symbol generator.

<a name="symbolType_draw" href="#symbolType_draw">#</a> <i>symbolType</i>.<b>draw</b>(<i>context</i>, <i>size</i>)

Renders this symbol type to the specified *context* with the specified *size* in square pixels. The *context* implements the [CanvasPathMethods](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#canvaspathmethods) interface. (Note that this is a subset of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface!)

### Stacks

[<img alt="Stacked Bar Chart" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/stacked-bar.png" width="295" height="154">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3886208)[<img alt="Streamgraph" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-shape/master/img/stacked-stream.png" width="295" height="154">](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954)

Some shape types can be stacked, placing one shape adjacent to another. For example, a bar chart of monthly sales might be broken down into a multi-series bar chart by product category, stacking bars vertically. This is equivalent to subdividing a bar chart by an ordinal dimension (such as product category) and applying a color encoding.

Stacked charts can show overall value and per-category value simultaneously; however, it is typically harder to compare across categories, as only the bottom layer of the stack is aligned. So, chose the [stack order](#stack_order) carefully, and consider a [streamgraph](#stackOffsetWiggle). (See also [grouped charts](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051).)

Like the [pie generator](#pies), the stack generator does not produce a shape directly. Instead it computes positions which you can then pass to an [area generator](#areas) or use directly, say to position bars.

<a name="stack" href="#stack">#</a> d3.<b>stack</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/stack.js "Source")

Constructs a new stack generator with the default settings.

<a name="_stack" href="#_stack">#</a> <i>stack</i>(<i>data</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/stack.js#L16 "Source")

Generates a stack for the given array of *data*, returning an array representing each series. Any additional *arguments* are arbitrary; they are simply propagated to accessors along with the `this` object.

The series are determined by the [keys accessor](#stack_keys); each series *i* in the returned array corresponds to the *i*th key. Each series is an array of points, where each point *j* corresponds to the *j*th element in the input *data*. Lastly, each point is represented as an array [*y0*, *y1*] where *y0* is the lower value (baseline) and *y1* is the upper value (topline); the difference between *y0* and *y1* corresponds to the computed [value](#stack_value) for this point. The key for each series is available as *series*.key, and the [index](#stack_order) as *series*.index. The input data element for each point is available as *point*.data.

For example, consider the following table representing monthly sales of fruits:

Month   | Apples | Bananas | Cherries | Dates
--------|--------|---------|----------|-------
 1/2015 |   3840 |    1920 |      960 |   400
 2/2015 |   1600 |    1440 |      960 |   400
 3/2015 |    640 |     960 |      640 |   400
 4/2015 |    320 |     480 |      640 |   400

This might be represented in JavaScript as an array of objects:

```js
var data = [
  {month: new Date(2015, 0, 1), apples: 3840, bananas: 1920, cherries: 960, dates: 400},
  {month: new Date(2015, 1, 1), apples: 1600, bananas: 1440, cherries: 960, dates: 400},
  {month: new Date(2015, 2, 1), apples:  640, bananas:  960, cherries: 640, dates: 400},
  {month: new Date(2015, 3, 1), apples:  320, bananas:  480, cherries: 640, dates: 400}
];
```

To produce a stack for this data:

```js
var stack = d3.stack()
    .keys(["apples", "bananas", "cherries", "dates"])
    .order(d3.stackOrderNone)
    .offset(d3.stackOffsetNone);

var series = stack(data);
```

The resulting array has one element per *series*. Each series has one point per month, and each point has a lower and upper value defining the baseline and topline:

```js
[
  [[   0, 3840], [   0, 1600], [   0,  640], [   0,  320]], // apples
  [[3840, 5760], [1600, 3040], [ 640, 1600], [ 320,  800]], // bananas
  [[5760, 6720], [3040, 4000], [1600, 2240], [ 800, 1440]], // cherries
  [[6720, 7120], [4000, 4400], [2240, 2640], [1440, 1840]], // dates
]
```

Each series in then typically passed to an [area generator](#areas) to render an area chart, or used to construct rectangles for a bar chart.

<a name="stack_keys" href="#stack_keys">#</a> <i>stack</i>.<b>keys</b>([<i>keys</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/stack.js#L40 "Source")

If *keys* is specified, sets the keys accessor to the specified function or array and returns this stack generator. If *keys* is not specified, returns the current keys accessor, which defaults to the empty array. A series (layer) is [generated](#_stack) for each key. Keys are typically strings, but they may be arbitrary values. The series key is passed to the [value accessor](#stack_value), along with each data point, to compute the points value.

<a name="stack_value" href="#stack_value">#</a> <i>stack</i>.<b>value</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/stack.js#L44 "Source")

If *value* is specified, sets the value accessor to the specified function or number and returns this stack generator. If *value* is not specified, returns the current value accessor, which defaults to:

```js
function value(d, key) {
  return d[key];
}
```

Thus, by default the stack generator assumes that the input data is an array of objects, with each object exposing named properties with numeric values; see [*stack*](#_stack) for an example.

<a name="stack_order" href="#stack_order">#</a> <i>stack</i>.<b>order</b>([<i>order</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/stack.js#L48 "Source")

If *order* is specified, sets the order accessor to the specified function or array and returns this stack generator. If *order* is not specified, returns the current order acccesor, which defaults to [stackOrderNone](#stackOrderNone); this uses the order given by the [key accessor](#stack_key). See [stack orders](#stack-orders) for the built-in orders.

If *order* is a function, it is passed the generated series array and must return an array of numeric indexes representing the stack order. For example, the default order is defined as:

```js
function orderNone(series) {
  var n = series.length, o = new Array(n);
  while (--n >= 0) o[n] = n;
  return o;
}
```

The stack order is computed prior to the [offset](#stack_offset); thus, the lower value for all points is zero at the time the order is computed. The index attribute for each series is also not set until after the order is computed.

<a name="stack_offset" href="#stack_offset">#</a> <i>stack</i>.<b>offset</b>([<i>offset</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/stack.js#L52 "Source")

If *offset* is specified, sets the offset accessor to the specified function or array and returns this stack generator. If *offset* is not specified, returns the current offset acccesor, which defaults to [stackOffsetNone](#stackOffsetNone); this uses a zero baseline. See [stack offsets](#stack-offsets) for the built-in offsets.

If *offset* is a function, it is passed the generated series array and the order index array. The offset function is then responsible for updating the lower and upper values in the series array to layout the stack. For example, the default offset is defined as:

```js
function offsetNone(series, order) {
  if (!((n = series.length) > 1)) return;
  for (var i = 1, s0, s1 = series[order[0]], n, m = s1.length; i < n; ++i) {
    s0 = s1, s1 = series[order[i]];
    for (var j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
      s1[j][1] += s1[j][0] = s0[j][1];
    }
  }
}
```

### Stack Orders

Stack orders are typically not used directly, but are instead passed to [*stack*.order](#stack_order).

<a name="stackOrderAscending" href="#stackOrderAscending">#</a> d3.<b>stackOrderAscending</b>(<i>series</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/order/ascending.js "Source")

Returns a series order such that the smallest series (according to the sum of values) is at the bottom.

<a name="stackOrderDescending" href="#stackOrderDescending">#</a> d3.<b>stackOrderDescending</b>(<i>series</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/order/descending.js "Source")

Returns a series order such that the largest series (according to the sum of values) is at the bottom.

<a name="stackOrderInsideOut" href="#stackOrderInsideOut">#</a> d3.<b>stackOrderInsideOut</b>(<i>series</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/order/insideOut.js "Source")

Returns a series order such that the larger series (according to the sum of values) are on the inside and the smaller series are on the outside. This order is recommended for streamgraphs in conjunction with the [wiggle offset](#stackOffsetWiggle). See [Stacked GraphsGeometry & Aesthetics](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/) by Byron & Wattenberg for more information.

<a name="stackOrderNone" href="#stackOrderNone">#</a> d3.<b>stackOrderNone</b>(<i>series</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/order/none.js "Source")

Returns the given series order [0, 1,  *n* - 1] where *n* is the number of elements in *series*. Thus, the stack order is given by the [key accessor](#stack_keys).

<a name="stackOrderReverse" href="#stackOrderReverse">#</a> d3.<b>stackOrderReverse</b>(<i>series</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/order/reverse.js "Source")

Returns the reverse of the given series order [*n* - 1, *n* - 2,  0] where *n* is the number of elements in *series*. Thus, the stack order is given by the reverse of the [key accessor](#stack_keys).

### Stack Offsets

Stack offsets are typically not used directly, but are instead passed to [*stack*.offset](#stack_offset).

<a name="stackOffsetExpand" href="#stackOffsetExpand">#</a> d3.<b>stackOffsetExpand</b>(<i>series</i>, <i>order</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/offset/expand.js "Source")

Applies a zero baseline and normalizes the values for each point such that the topline is always one.

<a name="stackOffsetDiverging" href="#stackOffsetDiverging">#</a> d3.<b>stackOffsetDiverging</b>(<i>series</i>, <i>order</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/offset/diverging.js "Source")

Positive values are stacked above zero, while negative values are [stacked below zero](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b5935342c6d21928111928401e2c8608).

<a name="stackOffsetNone" href="#stackOffsetNone">#</a> d3.<b>stackOffsetNone</b>(<i>series</i>, <i>order</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/offset/none.js "Source")

Applies a zero baseline.

<a name="stackOffsetSilhouette" href="#stackOffsetSilhouette">#</a> d3.<b>stackOffsetSilhouette</b>(<i>series</i>, <i>order</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/offset/silhouette.js "Source")

Shifts the baseline down such that the center of the streamgraph is always at zero.

<a name="stackOffsetWiggle" href="#stackOffsetWiggle">#</a> d3.<b>stackOffsetWiggle</b>(<i>series</i>, <i>order</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/src/offset/wiggle.js "Source")

Shifts the baseline so as to minimize the weighted wiggle of layers. This offset is recommended for streamgraphs in conjunction with the [inside-out order](#stackOrderInsideOut). See [Stacked GraphsGeometry & Aesthetics](http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/) by Bryon & Wattenberg for more information.

# d3-time

When visualizing time series data, analyzing temporal patterns, or working with time in general, the irregularities of conventional time units quickly become apparent. In the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar), for example, most months have 31 days but some have 28, 29 or 30; most years have 365 days but [leap years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year) have 366; and with [daylight saving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time), most days have 24 hours but some have 23 or 25. Adding to complexity, daylight saving conventions vary around the world.

As a result of these temporal peculiarities, it can be difficult to perform seemingly-trivial tasks. For example, if you want to compute the number of days that have passed between two dates, you cant simply subtract and divide by 24 hours (86,400,000 ms):

```js
var start = new Date(2015, 02, 01), // Sun Mar 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)
    end = new Date(2015, 03, 01); // Wed Apr 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)
(end - start) / 864e5; // 30.958333333333332, oops!
```

You can, however, use [d3.timeDay](#timeDay).[count](#interval_count):

```js
d3.timeDay.count(start, end); // 31
```

The [day](#day) [interval](#api-reference) is one of several provided by d3-time. Each interval represents a conventional unit of time[hours](#timeHour), [weeks](#timeWeek), [months](#timeMonth), *etc.*and has methods to calculate boundary dates. For example, [d3.timeDay](#timeDay) computes midnight (typically 12:00 AM local time) of the corresponding day. In addition to [rounding](#interval_round) and [counting](#interval_count), intervals can also be used to generate arrays of boundary dates. For example, to compute each Sunday in the current month:

```js
var now = new Date;
d3.timeWeek.range(d3.timeMonth.floor(now), d3.timeMonth.ceil(now));
// [Sun Jun 07 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Sun Jun 14 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Sun Jun 21 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT),
//  Sun Jun 28 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)]
```

The d3-time module does not implement its own calendaring system; it merely implements a convenient API for calendar math on top of ECMAScript [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). Thus, it ignores leap seconds and can only work with the local time zone and [Coordinated Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (UTC).

This module is used by D3s time scales to generate sensible ticks, by D3s time format, and can also be used directly to do things like [calendar layouts](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318).

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-time`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-time.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-time.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var day = d3.timeDay(new Date);

</script>
```

## API Reference

<a name="_interval" href="#_interval">#</a> <i>interval</i>(<i>date</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L6 "Source")

Alias for [*interval*.floor](#interval_floor). For example, [d3.timeYear](#timeYear)(*date*) and d3.timeYear.floor(*date*) are equivalent.

<a name="interval_floor" href="#interval_floor">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>floor</b>(<i>date</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L10 "Source")

Returns a new date representing the latest interval boundary date before or equal to *date*. For example, [d3.timeDay](#timeDay).floor(*date*) typically returns 12:00 AM local time on the given *date*.

This method is idempotent: if the specified *date* is already floored to the current interval, a new date with an identical time is returned. Furthermore, the returned date is the minimum expressible value of the associated interval, such that *interval*.floor(*interval*.floor(*date*) - 1) returns the preceeding interval boundary date.

Note that the `==` and `===` operators do not compare by value with [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) objects, and thus you cannot use them to tell whether the specified *date* has already been floored. Instead, coerce to a number and then compare:

```js
// Returns true if the specified date is a day boundary.
function isDay(date) {
  return +d3.timeDay.floor(date) === +date;
}
```

This is more reliable than testing whether the time is 12:00 AM, as in some time zones midnight may not exist due to daylight saving.

<a name="interval_round" href="#interval_round">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>round</b>(<i>date</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L16 "Source")

Returns a new date representing the closest interval boundary date to *date*. For example, [d3.timeDay](#timeDay).round(*date*) typically returns 12:00 AM local time on the given *date* if it is on or before noon, and 12:00 AM of the following day if it is after noon.

This method is idempotent: if the specified *date* is already rounded to the current interval, a new date with an identical time is returned.

<a name="interval_ceil" href="#interval_ceil">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>ceil</b>(<i>date</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L12 "Source")

Returns a new date representing the earliest interval boundary date after or equal to *date*. For example, [d3.timeDay](#timeDay).ceil(*date*) typically returns 12:00 AM local time on the date following the given *date*.

This method is idempotent: if the specified *date* is already ceilinged to the current interval, a new date with an identical time is returned. Furthermore, the returned date is the maximum expressible value of the associated interval, such that *interval*.ceil(*interval*.ceil(*date*) + 1) returns the following interval boundary date.

<a name="interval_offset" href="#interval_offset">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>offset</b>(<i>date</i>[, <i>step</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L22 "Source")

Returns a new date equal to *date* plus *step* intervals. If *step* is not specified it defaults to 1. If *step* is negative, then the returned date will be before the specified *date*; if *step* is zero, then a copy of the specified *date* is returned; if *step* is not an integer, it is [floored](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor). This method does not round the specified *date* to the interval. For example, if *date* is today at 5:34 PM, then [d3.timeDay](#timeDay).offset(*date*, 1) returns 5:34 PM tomorrow (even if daylight saving changes!).

<a name="interval_range" href="#interval_range">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>range</b>(<i>start</i>, <i>stop</i>[, <i>step</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L26 "Source")

Returns every an array of dates representing every interval boundary after or equal to *start* (inclusive) and before *stop* (exclusive). If *step* is specified, then every *step*th boundary will be returned; for example, for the [d3.timeDay](#timeDay) interval a *step* of 2 will return every other day. If *step* is not an integer, it is [floored](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor).

The first date in the returned array is the earliest boundary after or equal to *start*; subsequent dates are [offset](#interval_offset) by *step* intervals and [floored](#interval_floor). Thus, two overlapping ranges may be consistent. For example, this range contains odd days:

```js
d3.timeDay.range(new Date(2015, 0, 1), new Date(2015, 0, 7), 2);
// [Thu Jan 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 03 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Mon Jan 05 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)]
```

While this contains even days:

```js
d3.timeDay.range(new Date(2015, 0, 2), new Date(2015, 0, 8), 2);
// [Fri Jan 02 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sun Jan 04 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Tue Jan 06 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)]
```

To make ranges consistent when a *step* is specified, use [*interval*.every](#interval_every) instead.

<a name="interval_filter" href="#interval_filter">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>filter</b>(<i>test</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L35 "Source")

Returns a new interval that is a filtered subset of this interval using the specified *test* function. The *test* function is passed a date and should return true if and only if the specified date should be considered part of the interval. For example, to create an interval that returns the 1st, 11th, 21th and 31th (if it exists) of each month:

```js
var i = d3.timeDay.filter(function(d) { return (d.getDate() - 1) % 10 === 0; });
```

The returned filtered interval does not support [*interval*.count](#interval_count). See also [*interval*.every](#interval_every).

<a name="interval_every" href="#interval_every">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>every</b>(<i>step</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L50 "Source")

Returns a [filtered](#interval_filter) view of this interval representing every *step*th date. The meaning of *step* is dependent on this intervals parent interval as defined by the field function. For example, [d3.timeMinute](#timeMinute).every(15) returns an interval representing every fifteen minutes, starting on the hour: :00, :15, :30, :45, <i>etc.</i> Note that for some intervals, the resulting dates may not be uniformly-spaced; [d3.timeDay](#timeDay)s parent interval is [d3.timeMonth](#timeMonth), and thus the interval number resets at the start of each month. If *step* is not valid, returns null. If *step* is one, returns this interval.

This method can be used in conjunction with [*interval*.range](#interval_range) to ensure that two overlapping ranges are consistent. For example, this range contains odd days:

```js
d3.timeDay.every(2).range(new Date(2015, 0, 1), new Date(2015, 0, 7));
// [Thu Jan 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Sat Jan 03 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Mon Jan 05 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)]
```

As does this one:

```js
d3.timeDay.every(2).range(new Date(2015, 0, 2), new Date(2015, 0, 8));
// [Sat Jan 03 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Mon Jan 05 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST),
//  Wed Jan 07 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST)]
```

The returned filtered interval does not support [*interval*.count](#interval_count). See also [*interval*.filter](#interval_filter).

<a name="interval_count" href="#interval_count">#</a> <i>interval</i>.<b>count</b>(<i>start</i>, <i>end</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L44 "Source")

Returns the number of interval boundaries after *start* (exclusive) and before or equal to *end* (inclusive). Note that this behavior is slightly different than [*interval*.range](#interval_range) because its purpose is to return the zero-based number of the specified *end* date relative to the specified *start* date. For example, to compute the current zero-based day-of-year number:

```js
var now = new Date;
d3.timeDay.count(d3.timeYear(now), now); // 177
```

Likewise, to compute the current zero-based week-of-year number for weeks that start on Sunday:

```js
d3.timeSunday.count(d3.timeYear(now), now); // 25
```

<a name="timeInterval" href="#timeInterval">#</a> d3.<b>timeInterval</b>(<i>floor</i>, <i>offset</i>[, <i>count</i>[, <i>field</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time/blob/master/src/interval.js#L4 "Source")

Constructs a new custom interval given the specified *floor* and *offset* functions and an optional *count* function.

The *floor* function takes a single date as an argument and rounds it down to the nearest interval boundary.

The *offset* function takes a date and an integer step as arguments and advances the specified date by the specified number of boundaries; the step may be positive, negative or zero.

The optional *count* function takes a start date and an end date, already floored to the current interval, and returns the number of boundaries between the start (exclusive) and end (inclusive). If a *count* function is not specified, the returned interval does not expose [*interval*.count](#interval_count) or [*interval*.every](#interval_every) methods. Note: due to an internal optimization, the specified *count* function must not invoke *interval*.count on other time intervals.

The optional *field* function takes a date, already floored to the current interval, and returns the field value of the specified date, corresponding to the number of boundaries between this date (exclusive) and the latest previous parent boundary. For example, for the [d3.timeDay](#timeDay) interval, this returns the number of days since the start of the month. If a *field* function is not specified, it defaults to counting the number of interval boundaries since the UNIX epoch of January 1, 1970 UTC. The *field* function defines the behavior of [*interval*.every](#interval_every).

# d3-time-format

This module provides a JavaScript implementation of the venerable [strptime](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/strptime.html) and [strftime](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/strftime.html) functions from the C standard library, and can be used to parse or format [dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) in a variety of locale-specific representations. To format a date, create a [formatter](#locale_format) from a specifier (a string with the desired format *directives*, indicated by `%`); then pass a date to the formatter, which returns a string. For example, to convert the current date to a human-readable string:

```js
var formatTime = d3.timeFormat("%B %d, %Y");
formatTime(new Date); // "June 30, 2015"
```

Likewise, to convert a string back to a date, create a [parser](#locale_parse):

```js
var parseTime = d3.timeParse("%B %d, %Y");
parseTime("June 30, 2015"); // Tue Jun 30 2015 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)
```

You can implement more elaborate conditional time formats, too. For example, heres a [multi-scale time format](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4149176) using [time intervals](https://github.com/d3/d3-time):

```js
var formatMillisecond = d3.timeFormat(".%L"),
    formatSecond = d3.timeFormat(":%S"),
    formatMinute = d3.timeFormat("%I:%M"),
    formatHour = d3.timeFormat("%I %p"),
    formatDay = d3.timeFormat("%a %d"),
    formatWeek = d3.timeFormat("%b %d"),
    formatMonth = d3.timeFormat("%B"),
    formatYear = d3.timeFormat("%Y");

function multiFormat(date) {
  return (d3.timeSecond(date) < date ? formatMillisecond
      : d3.timeMinute(date) < date ? formatSecond
      : d3.timeHour(date) < date ? formatMinute
      : d3.timeDay(date) < date ? formatHour
      : d3.timeMonth(date) < date ? (d3.timeWeek(date) < date ? formatDay : formatWeek)
      : d3.timeYear(date) < date ? formatMonth
      : formatYear)(date);
}
```

This module is used by D3 [time scales](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#time-scales) to generate human-readable ticks.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-time-format`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-time-format.v2.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-time.v1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-time-format.v2.min.js"></script>
<script>

var format = d3.timeFormat("%x");

</script>
```

Locale files are hosted on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) and can be loaded using [d3.json](https://github.com/d3/d3-request/blob/master/README.md#json). For example, to set Russian as the default locale:

```js
d3.json("https://unpkg.com/d3-time-format@2/locale/ru-RU.json", function(error, locale) {
  if (error) throw error;

  d3.timeFormatDefaultLocale(locale);

  var format = d3.timeFormat("%c");

  console.log(format(new Date)); // ,  5  2016 . 10:31:59
});
```

<a name="isoFormat" href="#isoFormat">#</a> d3.<b>isoFormat</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/isoFormat.js "Source")

The full [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) UTC time formatter. Where available, this method will use [Date.toISOString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString) to format.

<a name="isoParse" href="#isoParse">#</a> d3.<b>isoParse</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/isoParse.js "Source")

The full [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) UTC time parser. Where available, this method will use the [Date constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) to parse strings. If you depend on strict validation of the input format according to ISO 8601, you should construct a [UTC parser function](#utcParse):

```js
var strictIsoParse = d3.utcParse("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%LZ");
```

<a name="locale_format" href="#locale_format">#</a> <i>locale</i>.<b>format</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/locale.js#L293 "Source")

Returns a new formatter for the given string *specifier*. The specifier string may contain the following directives:

* `%a` - abbreviated weekday name.*
* `%A` - full weekday name.*
* `%b` - abbreviated month name.*
* `%B` - full month name.*
* `%c` - the locales date and time, such as `%x, %X`.*
* `%d` - zero-padded day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].
* `%e` - space-padded day of the month as a decimal number [ 1,31]; equivalent to `%_d`.
* `%H` - hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23].
* `%I` - hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12].
* `%j` - day of the year as a decimal number [001,366].
* `%m` - month as a decimal number [01,12].
* `%M` - minute as a decimal number [00,59].
* `%L` - milliseconds as a decimal number [000, 999].
* `%p` - either AM or PM.*
* `%S` - second as a decimal number [00,61].
* `%U` - Sunday-based week of the year as a decimal number [00,53].
* `%w` - Sunday-based weekday as a decimal number [0,6].
* `%W` - Monday-based week of the year as a decimal number [00,53].
* `%x` - the locales date, such as `%-m/%-d/%Y`.*
* `%X` - the locales time, such as `%-I:%M:%S %p`.*
* `%y` - year without century as a decimal number [00,99].
* `%Y` - year with century as a decimal number.
* `%Z` - time zone offset, such as `-0700`, `-07:00`, `-07`, or `Z`.
* `%%` - a literal percent sign (`%`).

Directives marked with an asterisk (*) may be affected by the [locale definition](#localeFormat).

For `%U`, all days in a new year preceding the first Sunday are considered to be in week 0. For `%W`, all days in a new year preceding the first Monday are considered to be in week 0. Week numbers are computed using [*interval*.count](https://github.com/d3/d3-time#interval_count). For example, 2015-52 and 2016-00 represent Monday, December 28, 2015, while 2015-53 and 2016-01 represent Monday, January 4, 2016. This differs from the [ISO week date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date specification), which uses a more complicated definition!

The `%` sign indicating a directive may be immediately followed by a padding modifier:

* `0` - zero-padding
* `_` - space-padding
* `-` - disable padding

If no padding modifier is specified, the default is `0` for all directives except `%e`, which defaults to `_`. (In some implementations of strftime and strptime, a directive may include an optional field width or precision; this feature is not yet implemented.)

The returned function formats a specified *[date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)*, returning the corresponding string.

```js
var formatMonth = d3.timeFormat("%B"),
    formatDay = d3.timeFormat("%A"),
    date = new Date(2014, 4, 1); // Thu May 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)

formatMonth(date); // "May"
formatDay(date); // "Thursday"
```

<a name="locale_parse" href="#locale_parse">#</a> <i>locale</i>.<b>parse</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/locale.js#L298 "Source")

Returns a new parser for the given string *specifier*. The specifier string may contain the same directives as [*locale*.format](#locale_format). The `%d` and `%e` directives are considered equivalent for parsing.

The returned function parses a specified *string*, returning the corresponding [date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) or null if the string could not be parsed according to this formats specifier. Parsing is strict: if the specified <i>string</i> does not exactly match the associated specifier, this method returns null. For example, if the associated specifier is `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`, then the string `"2011-07-01T19:15:28Z"` will be parsed as expected, but `"2011-07-01T19:15:28"`, `"2011-07-01 19:15:28"` and `"2011-07-01"` will return null. (Note that the literal `Z` here is different from the time zone offset directive `%Z`.) If a more flexible parser is desired, try multiple formats sequentially until one returns non-null.

<a name="locale_utcFormat" href="#locale_utcFormat">#</a> <i>locale</i>.<b>utcFormat</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/locale.js#L303 "Source")

Equivalent to [*locale*.format](#locale_format), except all directives are interpreted as [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) rather than local time.

<a name="locale_utcParse" href="#locale_utcParse">#</a> <i>locale</i>.<b>utcParse</b>(<i>specifier</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/locale.js#L308 "Source")

Equivalent to [*locale*.parse](#locale_parse), except all directives are interpreted as [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) rather than local time.

### Locales

<a name="timeFormatLocale" href="#timeFormatLocale">#</a> d3.<b>timeFormatLocale</b>(<i>definition</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/locale.js "Source")

Returns a *locale* object for the specified *definition* with [*locale*.format](#locale_format), [*locale*.parse](#locale_parse), [*locale*.utcFormat](#locale_utcFormat), [*locale*.utcParse](#locale_utcParse) methods. The *definition* must include the following properties:

* `dateTime` - the date and time (`%c`) format specifier (<i>e.g.</i>, `"%a %b %e %X %Y"`).
* `date` - the date (`%x`) format specifier (<i>e.g.</i>, `"%m/%d/%Y"`).
* `time` - the time (`%X`) format specifier (<i>e.g.</i>, `"%H:%M:%S"`).
* `periods` - the A.M. and P.M. equivalents (<i>e.g.</i>, `["AM", "PM"]`).
* `days` - the full names of the weekdays, starting with Sunday.
* `shortDays` - the abbreviated names of the weekdays, starting with Sunday.
* `months` - the full names of the months (starting with January).
* `shortMonths` - the abbreviated names of the months (starting with January).

For an example, see [Localized Time Axis II](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/805115ebaa574e771db1875a6d828949).

<a name="timeFormatDefaultLocale" href="#timeFormatDefaultLocale">#</a> d3.<b>timeFormatDefaultLocale</b>(<i>definition</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/src/defaultLocale.js "Source")

Equivalent to [d3.timeFormatLocale](#timeFormatLocale), except it also redefines [d3.timeFormat](#timeFormat), [d3.timeParse](#timeParse), [d3.utcFormat](#utcFormat) and [d3.utcParse](#utcParse) to the new locales [*locale*.format](#locale_format), [*locale*.parse](#locale_parse), [*locale*.utcFormat](#locale_utcFormat) and [*locale*.utcParse](#locale_utcParse). If you do not set a default locale, it defaults to [U.S. English](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/blob/master/locale/en-US.json).

# d3-timer

This module provides an efficient queue capable of managing thousands of concurrent animations, while guaranteeing consistent, synchronized timing with concurrent or staged animations. Internally, it uses [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) for fluid animation (if available), switching to [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout) for delays longer than 24ms.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-timer`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-timer.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-timer.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var timer = d3.timer(callback);

</script>
```

[Try d3-timer in your browser.](https://tonicdev.com/npm/d3-timer)

## API Reference

<a name="now" href="#now">#</a> d3.<b>now</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/src/timer.js#L15 "Source")

Returns the current time as defined by [performance.now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now) if available, and [Date.now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) if not. The current time is updated at the start of a frame; it is thus consistent during the frame, and any timers scheduled during the same frame will be synchronized. If this method is called outside of a frame, such as in response to a user event, the current time is calculated and then fixed until the next frame, again ensuring consistent timing during event handling.

<a name="timer" href="#timer">#</a> d3.<b>timer</b>(<i>callback</i>[, <i>delay</i>[, <i>time</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/src/timer.js#L52 "Source")

Schedules a new timer, invoking the specified *callback* repeatedly until the timer is [stopped](#timer_stop). An optional numeric *delay* in milliseconds may be specified to invoke the given *callback* after a delay; if *delay* is not specified, it defaults to zero. The delay is relative to the specified *time* in milliseconds; if *time* is not specified, it defaults to [now](#now).

The *callback* is passed the (apparent) *elapsed* time since the timer became active. For example:

```js
var t = d3.timer(function(elapsed) {
  console.log(elapsed);
  if (elapsed > 200) t.stop();
}, 150);
```

This produces roughly the following console output:

```
3
25
48
65
85
106
125
146
167
189
209
```

(The exact values may vary depending on your JavaScript runtime and what else your computer is doing.) Note that the first *elapsed* time is 3ms: this is the elapsed time since the timer started, not since the timer was scheduled. Here the timer started 150ms after it was scheduled due to the specified delay. The apparent *elapsed* time may be less than the true *elapsed* time if the page is backgrounded and [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) is paused; in the background, apparent time is frozen.

If [timer](#timer) is called within the callback of another timer, the new timer callback (if eligible as determined by the specified *delay* and *time*) will be invoked immediately at the end of the current frame, rather than waiting until the next frame. Within a frame, timer callbacks are guaranteed to be invoked in the order they were scheduled, regardless of their start time.

<a name="timer_restart" href="#timer_restart">#</a> <i>timer</i>.<b>restart</b>(<i>callback</i>[, <i>delay</i>[, <i>time</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/src/timer.js#L31 "Source")

Restart a timer with the specified *callback* and optional *delay* and *time*. This is equivalent to stopping this timer and creating a new timer with the specified arguments, although this timer retains the original invocation priority.

<a name="timer_stop" href="#timer_stop">#</a> <i>timer</i>.<b>stop</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/src/timer.js#L43 "Source")

Stops this timer, preventing subsequent callbacks. This method has no effect if the timer has already stopped.

<a name="timerFlush" href="#timerFlush">#</a> d3.<b>timerFlush</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/src/timer.js#L58 "Source")

Immediately invoke any eligible timer callbacks. Note that zero-delay timers are normally first executed after one frame (~17ms). This can cause a brief flicker because the browser renders the page twice: once at the end of the first event loop, then again immediately on the first timer callback. By flushing the timer queue at the end of the first event loop, you can run any zero-delay timers immediately and avoid the flicker.

<a name="timeout" href="#timeout">#</a> d3.<b>timeout</b>(<i>callback</i>[, <i>delay</i>[, <i>time</i>]]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer/blob/master/src/timeout.js "Source")

Like [timer](#timer), except the timer automatically [stops](#timer_stop) on its first callback. A suitable replacement for [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout) that is guaranteed to not run in the background.

# d3-transition

A transition is a [selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection)-like interface for animating changes to the DOM. Instead of applying changes instantaneously, transitions smoothly interpolate the DOM from its current state to the desired target state over a given duration.

To apply a transition, select elements, call [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition), and then make the desired changes. For example:

```js
d3.select("body")
  .transition()
    .style("background-color", "red");
```

Transitions support most selection methods (such as [*transition*.attr](#transition_attr) and [*transition*.style](#transition_style) in place of [*selection*.attr](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_attr) and [*selection*.style](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_style)), but not all methods are supported; for example, you must [append](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_append) elements or [bind data](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#joining-data) before a transition starts. A [*transition*.remove](#transition_remove) operator is provided for convenient removal of elements when the transition ends.

To compute intermediate state, transitions leverage a variety of [built-in interpolators](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate). [Colors](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateRgb), [numbers](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateNumber), and [transforms](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateTransform) are automatically detected. [Strings](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateString) with embedded numbers are also detected, as is common with many styles (such as padding or font sizes) and paths. To specify a custom interpolator, use [*transition*.attrTween](#transition_attrTween), [*transition*.styleTween](#transition_styleTween) or [*transition*.tween](#transition_tween).

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-transition`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-transition.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

### Selecting Elements

Transitions are derived from [selections](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection) via [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition). You can also create a transition on the document root element using [d3.transition](#transition).

<a name="selection_transition" href="#selection_transition">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>transition</b>([<i>name</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/selection/transition.js "Source")

Returns a new transition on the given *selection* with the specified *name*. If a *name* is not specified, null is used. The new transition is only exclusive with other transitions of the same name.

If the *name* is a [transition](#transition) instance, the returned transition has the same id and name as the specified transition. If a transition with the same id already exists on a selected element, the existing transition is returned for that element. Otherwise, the timing of the returned transition is inherited from the existing transition of the same id on the nearest ancestor of each selected element. Thus, this method can be used to synchronize a transition across multiple selections, or to re-select a transition for specific elements and modify its configuration. For example:

```js
var t = d3.transition()
    .duration(750)
    .ease(d3.easeLinear);

d3.selectAll(".apple").transition(t)
    .style("fill", "red");

d3.selectAll(".orange").transition(t)
    .style("fill", "orange");
```

If the specified *transition* is not found on a selected node or its ancestors (such as if the transition [already ended](#the-life-of-a-transition)), the default timing parameters are used; however, in a future release, this will likely be changed to throw an error. See [#59](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/issues/59).

<a name="selection_interrupt" href="#selection_interrupt">#</a> <i>selection</i>.<b>interrupt</b>([<i>name</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/selection/interrupt.js "Source")

Interrupts the active transition of the specified *name* on the selected elements, and cancels any pending transitions with the specified *name*, if any. If a name is not specified, null is used.

Interrupting a transition on an element has no effect on any transitions on any descendant elements. For example, an [axis transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis) consists of multiple independent, synchronized transitions on the descendants of the axis [G element](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups) (the tick lines, the tick labels, the domain path, *etc.*). To interrupt the axis transition, you must therefore interrupt the descendants:

```js
selection.selectAll("*").interrupt();
```

The [universal selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors), `*`, selects all descendant elements. If you also want to interrupt the G element itself:

```js
selection.interrupt().selectAll("*").interrupt();
```

<a name="interrupt" href="#interrupt">#</a> d3.<b>interrupt</b>(<i>node</i>[, <i>name</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/interrupt.js "Source")

Interrupts the active transition of the specified *name* on the specified *node*, and cancels any pending transitions with the specified *name*, if any. If a name is not specified, null is used. See also [*selection*.interrupt](#selection_interrupt).

<a name="transition" href="#transition">#</a> d3.<b>transition</b>([<i>name</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/index.js#L29 "Source")

Returns a new transition on the root element, `document.documentElement`, with the specified *name*. If a *name* is not specified, null is used. The new transition is only exclusive with other transitions of the same name. The *name* may also be a [transition](#transition) instance; see [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition). This method is equivalent to:

```js
d3.selection()
  .transition(name)
```

This function can also be used to test for transitions (`instanceof d3.transition`) or to extend the transition prototype.

<a name="transition_select" href="#transition_select">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>select</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/select.js "Source")

For each selected element, selects the first descendant element that matches the specified *selector* string, if any, and returns a transition on the resulting selection. The *selector* may be specified either as a selector string or a function. If a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The new transition has the same id, name and timing as this transition; however, if a transition with the same id already exists on a selected element, the existing transition is returned for that element.

This method is equivalent to deriving the selection for this transition via [*transition*.selection](#transition_selection), creating a subselection via [*selection*.select](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_select), and then creating a new transition via [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition):

```js
transition
  .selection()
  .select(selector)
  .transition(transition)
```

<a name="transition_selectAll" href="#transition_selectAll">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>selectAll</b>(<i>selector</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/selectAll.js "Source")

For each selected element, selects all descendant elements that match the specified *selector* string, if any, and returns a transition on the resulting selection. The *selector* may be specified either as a selector string or a function. If a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The new transition has the same id, name and timing as this transition; however, if a transition with the same id already exists on a selected element, the existing transition is returned for that element.

This method is equivalent to deriving the selection for this transition via [*transition*.selection](#transition_selection), creating a subselection via [*selection*.selectAll](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_selectAll), and then creating a new transition via [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition):

```js
transition
  .selection()
  .selectAll(selector)
  .transition(transition)
```

<a name="transition_filter" href="#transition_filter">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>filter</b>(<i>filter</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/filter.js "Source")

For each selected element, selects only the elements that match the specified *filter*, and returns a transition on the resulting selection. The *filter* may be specified either as a selector string or a function. If a function, it is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The new transition has the same id, name and timing as this transition; however, if a transition with the same id already exists on a selected element, the existing transition is returned for that element.

This method is equivalent to deriving the selection for this transition via [*transition*.selection](#transition_selection), creating a subselection via [*selection*.filter](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_filter), and then creating a new transition via [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition):

```js
transition
  .selection()
  .filter(filter)
  .transition(transition)
```

<a name="transition_merge" href="#transition_merge">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>merge</b>(<i>other</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/merge.js "Source")

Returns a new transition merging this transition with the specified *other* transition, which must have the same id as this transition. The returned transition has the same number of groups, the same parents, the same name and the same id as this transition. Any missing (null) elements in this transition are filled with the corresponding element, if present (not null), from the *other* transition.

This method is equivalent to deriving the selection for this transition via [*transition*.selection](#transition_selection), merging with the selection likewise derived from the *other* transition via [*selection*.merge](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_merge), and then creating a new transition via [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition):

```js
transition
  .selection()
  .merge(other.selection())
  .transition(transition)
```

<a name="transition_transition" href="#transition_transition">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>transition</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/transition.js "Source")

Returns a new transition on the same selected elements as this transition, scheduled to start when this transition ends. The new transition inherits a reference time equal to this transitions time plus its [delay](#transition_delay) and [duration](#transition_duration). The new transition also inherits this transitions name, duration, and [easing](#transition_ease). This method can be used to schedule a sequence of chained transitions. For example:

```js
d3.selectAll(".apple")
  .transition() // First fade to green.
    .style("fill", "green")
  .transition() // Then red.
    .style("fill", "red")
  .transition() // Wait one second. Then brown, and remove.
    .delay(1000)
    .style("fill", "brown")
    .remove();
```

The delay for each transition is relative to its previous transition. Thus, in the above example, apples will stay red for one second before the last transition to brown starts.

<a name="transition_selection" href="#transition_selection">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>selection</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/selection.js "Source")

Returns the [selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection) corresponding to this transition.

<a name="active" href="#active">#</a> d3.<b>active</b>(<i>node</i>[, <i>name</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/active.js "Source")

Returns the active transition on the specified *node* with the specified *name*, if any. If no *name* is specified, null is used. Returns null if there is no such active transition on the specified node. This method is useful for creating chained transitions. For example, to initiate disco mode:

```js
d3.selectAll("circle").transition()
    .delay(function(d, i) { return i * 50; })
    .on("start", function repeat() {
        d3.active(this)
            .style("fill", "red")
          .transition()
            .style("fill", "green")
          .transition()
            .style("fill", "blue")
          .transition()
            .on("start", repeat);
      });
```

See [chained transitions](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/70d5541b547cc222aa02) for an example.

### Modifying Elements

After selecting elements and creating a transition with [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition), use the transitions transformation methods to affect document content.

<a name="transition_attr" href="#transition_attr">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>attr</b>(<i>name</i>, <i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/attr.js "Source")

For each selected element, assigns the [attribute tween](#transition_attrTween) for the attribute with the specified *name* to the specified target *value*. The starting value of the tween is the attributes value when the transition starts. The target *value* may be specified either as a constant or a function. If a function, it is immediately evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

If the target value is null, the attribute is removed when the transition starts. Otherwise, an interpolator is chosen based on the type of the target value, using the following algorithm:

1. If *value* is a number, use [interpolateNumber](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateNumber).
2. If *value* is a [color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#color) or a string coercible to a color, use [interpolateRgb](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateRgb).
3. Use [interpolateString](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateString).

To apply a different interpolator, use [*transition*.attrTween](#transition_attrTween).

<a name="transition_attrTween" href="#transition_attrTween">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>attrTween</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>factory</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/attrTween.js "Source")

If *factory* is specified and not null, assigns the attribute [tween](#transition_tween) for the attribute with the specified *name* to the specified interpolator *factory*. An interpolator factory is a function that returns an [interpolator](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate); when the transition starts, the *factory* is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The returned interpolator will then be invoked for each frame of the transition, in order, being passed the [eased](#transition_ease) time *t*, typically in the range [0, 1]. Lastly, the return value of the interpolator will be used to set the attribute value. The interpolator must return a string. (To remove an attribute at the start of a transition, use [*transition*.attr](#transition_attr); to remove an attribute at the end of a transition, use [*transition*.on](#transition_on) to listen for the *end* event.)

If the specified *factory* is null, removes the previously-assigned attribute tween of the specified *name*, if any. If *factory* is not specified, returns the current interpolator factory for attribute with the specified *name*, or undefined if no such tween exists.

For example, to interpolate the fill attribute from red to blue:

```js
transition.attrTween("fill", function() {
  return d3.interpolateRgb("red", "blue");
});
```

Or to interpolate from the current fill to blue, like [*transition*.attr](#transition_attr):

```js
transition.attrTween("fill", function() {
  return d3.interpolateRgb(this.getAttribute("fill"), "blue");
});
```

Or to apply a custom rainbow interpolator:

```js
transition.attrTween("fill", function() {
  return function(t) {
    return "hsl(" + t * 360 + ",100%,50%)";
  };
});
```

This method is useful to specify a custom interpolator, such as one that understands [SVG paths](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3916621). A useful technique is *data interpolation*, where [d3.interpolateObject](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateObject) is used to interpolate two data values, and the resulting value is then used (say, with a [shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape)) to compute the new attribute value.

<a name="transition_style" href="#transition_style">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>style</b>(<i>name</i>, <i>value</i>[, <i>priority</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/style.js "Source")

For each selected element, assigns the [style tween](#transition_styleTween) for the style with the specified *name* to the specified target *value* with the specified *priority*. The starting value of the tween is the styles inline value if present, and otherwise its computed value, when the transition starts. The target *value* may be specified either as a constant or a function. If a function, it is immediately evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

If the target value is null, the style is removed when the transition starts. Otherwise, an interpolator is chosen based on the type of the target value, using the following algorithm:

1. If *value* is a number, use [interpolateNumber](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateNumber).
2. If *value* is a [color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color#color) or a string coercible to a color, use [interpolateRgb](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateRgb).
3. Use [interpolateString](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateString).

To apply a different interpolator, use [*transition*.styleTween](#transition_styleTween).

<a name="transition_styleTween" href="#transition_styleTween">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>styleTween</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>factory</i>[, <i>priority</i>]])) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/styleTween.js "Source")

If *factory* is specified and not null, assigns the style [tween](#transition_tween) for the style with the specified *name* to the specified interpolator *factory*. An interpolator factory is a function that returns an [interpolator](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate); when the transition starts, the *factory* is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The returned interpolator will then be invoked for each frame of the transition, in order, being passed the [eased](#transition_ease) time *t*, typically in the range [0, 1]. Lastly, the return value of the interpolator will be used to set the style value with the specified *priority*. The interpolator must return a string. (To remove an style at the start of a transition, use [*transition*.style](#transition_style); to remove an style at the end of a transition, use [*transition*.on](#transition_on) to listen for the *end* event.)

If the specified *factory* is null, removes the previously-assigned style tween of the specified *name*, if any. If *factory* is not specified, returns the current interpolator factory for style with the specified *name*, or undefined if no such tween exists.

For example, to interpolate the fill style from red to blue:

```js
transition.styleTween("fill", function() {
  return d3.interpolateRgb("red", "blue");
});
```

Or to interpolate from the current fill to blue, like [*transition*.style](#transition_style):

```js
transition.styleTween("fill", function() {
  return d3.interpolateRgb(this.style.fill, "blue");
});
```

Or to apply a custom rainbow interpolator:

```js
transition.styleTween("fill", function() {
  return function(t) {
    return "hsl(" + t * 360 + ",100%,50%)";
  };
});
```

This method is useful to specify a custom interpolator, such as with *data interpolation*, where [d3.interpolateObject](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateObject) is used to interpolate two data values, and the resulting value is then used to compute the new style value.

<a name="transition_text" href="#transition_text">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>text</b>(<i>value</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/text.js "Source")

For each selected element, sets the [text content](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#Node3-textContent) to the specified target *value* when the transition starts. The *value* may be specified either as a constant or a function. If a function, it is immediately evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The functions return value is then used to set each elements text content. A null value will clear the content.

To interpolate text rather than to set it on start, use [*transition*.tween](#transition_tween) ([for example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7004f92cac972edef365)) or append a replacement element and cross-fade opacity ([for example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/f7dcecb19c4af317e464)). Text is not interpolated by default because it is usually undesirable.

<a name="transition_remove" href="#transition_remove">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>remove</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/remove.js "Source")

For each selected element, [removes](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_remove) the element when the transition ends, as long as the element has no other active or pending transitions. If the element has other active or pending transitions, does nothing.

<a name="transition_tween" href="#transition_tween">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>tween</b>(<i>name</i>[, <i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/tween.js "Source")

For each selected element, assigns the tween with the specified *name* with the specified *value* function. The *value* must be specified as a function that returns a function. When the transition starts, the *value* function is evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The returned function is then invoked for each frame of the transition, in order, being passed the [eased](#transition_ease) time *t*, typically in the range [0, 1]. If the specified *value* is null, removes the previously-assigned tween of the specified *name*, if any.

For example, to interpolate the fill attribute to blue, like [*transition*.attr](#transition_attr):

```js
transition.tween("attr.fill", function() {
  var node = this, i = d3.interpolateRgb(node.getAttribute("fill"), "blue");
  return function(t) {
    node.setAttribute("fill", i(t));
  };
});
```

This method is useful to specify a custom interpolator, or to perform side-effects, say to animate the [scroll offset](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1649463).

### Timing

The [easing](#transition_ease), [delay](#transition_delay) and [duration](#transition_duration) of a transition is configurable. For example, a per-element delay can be used to [stagger the reordering](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885705) of elements, improving perception. See [Animated Transitions in Statistical Data Graphics](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/animated_transitions/) for recommendations.

<a name="transition_delay" href="#transition_delay">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>delay</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/delay.js "Source")

For each selected element, sets the transition delay to the specified *value* in milliseconds. The *value* may be specified either as a constant or a function. If a function, it is immediately evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The functions return value is then used to set each elements transition delay. If a delay is not specified, it defaults to zero.

If a *value* is not specified, returns the current value of the delay for the first (non-null) element in the transition. This is generally useful only if you know that the transition contains exactly one element.

Setting the delay to a multiple of the index `i` is a convenient way to stagger transitions across a set of elements. For example:

```js
transition.delay(function(d, i) { return i * 10; });
```

Of course, you can also compute the delay as a function of the data, or [sort the selection](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_sort) before computed an index-based delay.

<a name="transition_duration" href="#transition_duration">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>duration</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/duration.js "Source")

For each selected element, sets the transition duration to the specified *value* in milliseconds. The *value* may be specified either as a constant or a function. If a function, it is immediately evaluated for each selected element, in order, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The functions return value is then used to set each elements transition duration. If a duration is not specified, it defaults to 250ms.

If a *value* is not specified, returns the current value of the duration for the first (non-null) element in the transition. This is generally useful only if you know that the transition contains exactly one element.

<a name="transition_ease" href="#transition_ease">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>ease</b>([<i>value</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/ease.js "Source")

Specifies the transition [easing function](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease) for all selected elements. The *value* must be specified as a function. The easing function is invoked for each frame of the animation, being passed the normalized time *t* in the range [0, 1]; it must then return the eased time *t* which is typically also in the range [0, 1]. A good easing function should return 0 if *t* = 0 and 1 if *t* = 1. If an easing function is not specified, it defaults to [d3.easeCubic](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease#easeCubic).

If a *value* is not specified, returns the current easing function for the first (non-null) element in the transition. This is generally useful only if you know that the transition contains exactly one element.

### Control Flow

For advanced usage, transitions provide methods for custom control flow.

<a name="transition_on" href="#transition_on">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>[, <i>listener</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/src/transition/on.js "Source")

Adds or removes a *listener* to each selected element for the specified event *typenames*. The *typenames* is one of the following string event types:

* `start` - when the transition starts.
* `end` - when the transition ends.
* `interrupt` - when the transition is interrupted.

See [The Life of a Transition](#the-life-of-a-transition) for more. Note that these are *not* native DOM events as implemented by [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) and [*selection*.dispatch](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_dispatch), but transition events!

The type may be optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a name; the optional name allows multiple callbacks to be registered to receive events of the same type, such as `start.foo` and `start.bar`. To specify multiple typenames, separate typenames with spaces, such as `interrupt end` or `start.foo start.bar`.

When a specified transition event is dispatched on a selected node, the specified *listener* will be invoked for the transitioning element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. Listeners always see the latest datum for their element, but the index is a property of the selection and is fixed when the listener is assigned; to update the index, re-assign the listener.

If an event listener was previously registered for the same *typename* on a selected element, the old listener is removed before the new listener is added. To remove a listener, pass null as the *listener*. To remove all listeners for a given name, pass null as the *listener* and `.foo` as the *typename*, where `foo` is the name; to remove all listeners with no name, specify `.` as the *typename*.

If a *listener* is not specified, returns the currently-assigned listener for the specified event *typename* on the first (non-null) selected element, if any. If multiple typenames are specified, the first matching listener is returned.

<a name="transition_each" href="#transition_each">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>each</b>(<i>function</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/each.js "Source")

Invokes the specified *function* for each selected element, passing in the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context of the current DOM element. This method can be used to invoke arbitrary code for each selected element, and is useful for creating a context to access parent and child data simultaneously. Equivalent to [*selection*.each](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_each).

<a name="transition_call" href="#transition_call">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>call</b>(<i>function</i>[, <i>arguments</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/call.js "Source")

Invokes the specified *function* exactly once, passing in this transition along with any optional *arguments*. Returns this transition. This is equivalent to invoking the function by hand but facilitates method chaining. For example, to set several attributes in a reusable function:

```js
function color(transition, fill, stroke) {
  transition
      .style("fill", fill)
      .style("stroke", stroke);
}
```

Now say:

```js
d3.selectAll("div").transition().call(color, "red", "blue");
```

This is equivalent to:

```js
color(d3.selectAll("div").transition(), "red", "blue");
```

Equivalent to [*selection*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_call).

<a name="transition_empty" href="#transition_empty">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>empty</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/empty.js "Source")

Returns true if this transition contains no (non-null) elements. Equivalent to [*selection*.empty](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_empty).

<a name="transition_nodes" href="#transition_nodes">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>nodes</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/nodes.js "Source")

Returns an array of all (non-null) elements in this transition. Equivalent to [*selection*.nodes](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_nodes).

<a name="transition_node" href="#transition_node">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>node</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/node.js "Source")

Returns the first (non-null) element in this transition. If the transition is empty, returns null. Equivalent to [*selection*.node](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_node).

<a name="transition_size" href="#transition_size">#</a> <i>transition</i>.<b>size</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/selection/size.js "Source")

Returns the total number of elements in this transition. Equivalent to [*selection*.size](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_size).

### The Life of a Transition

Immediately after creating a transition, such as by [*selection*.transition](#selection_transition) or [*transition*.transition](#transition_transition), you may configure the transition using methods such as [*transition*.delay](#transition_delay), [*transition*.duration](#transition_duration), [*transition*.attr](#transition_attr) and [*transition*.style](#transition_style). Methods that specify target values (such as *transition*.attr) are evaluated synchronously; however, methods that require the starting value for interpolation, such as [*transition*.attrTween](#transition_attrTween) and [*transition*.styleTween](#transition_styleTween), must be deferred until the transition starts.

Shortly after creation, either at the end of the current frame or during the next frame, the transition is scheduled. At this point, the delay and `start` event listeners may no longer be changed.

When the transition subsequently starts, it interrupts the active transition of the same name on the same element, if any, dispatching an `interrupt` event to registered listeners. (Note that interrupts happen on start, not creation, and thus even a zero-delay transition will not immediately interrupt the active transition: the old transition is given a final frame. Use [*selection*.interrupt](#selection_interrupt) to interrupt immediately.) The starting transition also cancels any pending transitions of the same name on the same element that were created before the starting transition. The transition then dispatches a `start` event to registered listeners. This is the last moment at which the transition may be modified: after starting, the transitions timing, tweens, and listeners may no longer be changed. The transition initializes its tweens immediately after starting.

During the frame the transition starts, but *after* all transitions starting this frame have been started, the transition invokes its tweens for the first time. Batching tween initialization, which typically involves reading from the DOM, improves performance by avoiding interleaved DOM reads and writes.

For each frame that a transition is active, it invokes its tweens with an [eased](#transition_ease) *t*-value ranging from 0 to 1. Within each frame, the transition invokes its tweens in the order they were registered.

When a transition ends, it invokes its tweens a final time with a (non-eased) *t*-value of 1. It then dispatches an `end` event to registered listeners. This is the last moment at which the transition may be inspected: after ending, the transition is deleted from the element, and its configuration is destroyed. (A transitions configuration is also destroyed on interrupt or cancel.)

# d3-voronoi

This module implements [Steven J. Fortunes algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune's_algorithm) for computing the [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) or [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) of a set of two-dimensional points. This implementation is largely based on [work by Raymond Hill](http://www.raymondhill.net/voronoi/rhill-voronoi.html).

Voronoi diagrams are not only [visually](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4360892) [attractive](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4636377) but practical tools for interaction, such as to increase the target area of points in a scatterplot. See [Strikeouts on the Rise](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/29/sports/baseball/Strikeouts-Are-Still-Soaring.html) in *The New York Times* and this [multi-line chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/8033015) for examples; also see Tovi Grossmans paper on [bubble cursors](http://www.tovigrossman.com/BubbleCursor) for a related technique. Voronoi diagrams can also be used to [automate label positioning](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6909318), and Delaunay meshes are useful in computing adjacency or grouping of visual elements.

The *extent* bounds are specified as an array \[\[<i>x0</i>, <i>y0</i>\], \[<i>x1</i>, <i>y1</i>\]\], where <i>x0</i> is the left side of the extent, <i>y0</i> is the top, <i>x1</i> is the right and <i>y1</i> is the bottom. If *extent* is not specified, returns the current clip extent which defaults to null. A clip extent is required when using [*voronoi*.polygons](#voronoi_polygons).

<a name="voronoi_size" href="#voronoi_size">#</a> <i>voronoi</i>.<b>size</b>([<i>size</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/src/voronoi.js#L43 "Source")

### Voronoi Diagrams

<a name="diagram" href="#diagram">#</a> <i>diagram</i> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/src/Diagram.js "Source")

The computed Voronoi diagram returned by [*voronoi*](#_voronoi) has the following properties:

* `edges` - an array of [edges](#diagram_edge).
* `cells` - a sparse array of [cells](#diagram_cell), one for each unique input point.

For each set of coincident input points, one of the points is chosen arbitrarily and assigned the associated cell; the other coincident input points entries are missing from the returned sparse array.

<a name="diagram_polygons" href="#diagram_polygons">#</a> <i>diagram</i>.<b>polygons</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/src/Diagram.js#L72 "Source")

Returns a sparse array of polygons clipped to the [*extent*](#voronoi_extent), one for each cell (each unique input point) in the diagram. Each polygon is represented as an array of points \[*x*, *y*\] where *x* and *y* are the point coordinates, and a `data` field that refers to the corresponding element in *data*. Polygons are open: they do not contain a closing point that duplicates the first point; a triangle, for example, is an array of three points. Polygons are also counterclockwise, assuming the origin 0,0 is in the top-left corner.

For each set of coincident input points, one of the points is chosen arbitrarily and assigned the associated polygon; the other coincident input points entries are missing from the returned sparse array.

<a name="diagram_triangles" href="#diagram_triangles">#</a> <i>diagram</i>.<b>triangles</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/src/Diagram.js#L82 "Source")

Returns the Delaunay triangulation of the specified *data* array as an array of triangles. Each triangle is a three-element array of elements from *data*. Since the triangulation is computed as the dual of the Voronoi diagram, and the Voronoi diagram is clipped by the [extent](#voronoi_extent), a subset of the Delaunay triangulation is returned.

<a name="diagram_links" href="#diagram_links">#</a> <i>diagram</i>.<b>links</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/src/Diagram.js#L108 "Source")

Returns the Delaunay triangulation of the specified *data* array as an array of links, one for each edge in the mesh. Each link has the following attributes:

* `source` - the source node, an element in *data*.
* `target` - the target node, an element in *data*.

Since the triangulation is computed as the dual of the Voronoi diagram, and the Voronoi diagram is clipped by the [extent](#voronoi_extent), a subset of the Delaunay links is returned.

<a name="diagram_find" href="#diagram_find">#</a> <i>diagram</i>.<b>find</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>[, <i>radius</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi/blob/master/src/Diagram.js#L119 "Source")

Returns the nearest site to point \[*x*, *y*\]. If *radius* is specified, only sites within *radius* distance are considered.

See Philippe Rivires [bl.ocks.org/1b7ddbcd71454d685d1259781968aefc](http://bl.ocks.org/Fil/1b7ddbcd71454d685d1259781968aefc) for an example.

<a name="cell" href="#cell">#</a> <i>cell</i>

Each cell in the diagram is an object with the following properties:

* `site` - the [site](#site) of the cells associated input point.
* `halfedges` - an array of indexes into [*diagram*.edges](#diagram) representing the cells polygon.

<a name="site" href="#site">#</a> <i>site</i>

Each site in the diagram is an array \[*x*, *y*\] with two additional properties:

* `index` - the sites index, corresponding to the associated input point.
* `data` - the input data corresponding to this site.

<a name="edge" href="#edge">#</a> <i>edge</i>

Each edge in the diagram is an array \[\[*x0*, *y0*\], \[*x1*, *y1*\]\] with two additional properties:

* `left` - the [site](#site) on the left side of the edge.
* `right` - the [site](#site) on the right side of the edge; null for a clipped border edge.

# d3-zoom

Panning and zooming are popular interaction techniques which let the user focus on a region of interest by restricting the view. It is easy to learn due to direct manipulation: click-and-drag to pan (translate), spin the wheel to zoom (scale), or use touch. Panning and zooming are widely used in web-based mapping, but can also be used with visualizations such as time-series and scatterplots.

The zoom behavior implemented by d3-zoom is a convenient but flexible abstraction for enabling pan-and-zoom on [selections](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection). It handles a surprising variety of [input events](#api-reference ) and browser quirks. The zoom behavior is agnostic about the DOM, so you can use it with SVG, HTML or Canvas.

[<img alt="Canvas Zooming" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-zoom/master/img/dots.png" width="420" height="219">](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/d1f7b58631e71fbf9c568345ee04a60e)[<img alt="SVG Zooming" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-zoom/master/img/dots.png" width="420" height="219">](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4e3925cdc804db257a86fdef3a032a45)

The zoom behavior is also designed to work with [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) and [d3-axis](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis); see [*transform*.rescaleX](#transform_rescaleX) and [*transform*.rescaleY](#transform_rescaleY). You can also restrict zooming using [*zoom*.scaleExtent](#zoom_scaleExtent) and panning using [*zoom*.translateExtent](#zoom_translateExtent).

[<img alt="Axis Zooming" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-zoom/master/img/axis.png" width="420" height="219">](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/db6b4335bf1662b413e7968910104f0f)

The zoom behavior can be combined with other behaviors, such as [d3-drag](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag) for dragging, and [d3-brush](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush) for focus + context.

[<img alt="Drag & Zoom II" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-zoom/master/img/dots.png" width="420" height="219">](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3127661b6f13f9316be745e77fdfb084)[<img alt="Brush & Zoom" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-zoom/master/img/brush.png" width="420" height="219">](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/34f08d5e11952a80609169b7917d4172)

The zoom behavior can be controlled programmatically using [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform), allowing you to implement user interface controls which drive the display or to stage animated tours through your data. Smooth zoom transitions are based on [Smooth and efficient zooming and panning](http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/zoompan.pdf) by Jarke J. van Wijk and Wim A.A. Nuij.

[<img alt="Zoom Transitions" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3/d3-zoom/master/img/transition.png" width="420" height="219">](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b783fbb2e673561d214e09c7fb5cedee)

See also [d3-tile](https://github.com/d3/d3-tile) for examples panning and zooming maps.

## API Reference

This table describes how the zoom behavior interprets native events:

| Event        | Listening Element | Zoom Event  | Default Prevented? |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| mousedown   | selection         | start       | no                |

| dblclick     | selection         | *multiple* | yes                |
| wheel       | selection         | zoom       | yes                |
| touchstart   | selection         | *multiple* | no                |
| touchmove    | selection         | zoom        | yes                |
| touchend     | selection         | end         | no                |
| touchcancel  | selection         | end         | no                |

The propagation of all consumed events is [immediately stopped](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-stopimmediatepropagation).

 Necessary to capture events outside an iframe; see [d3-drag#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br> Only applies during an active, mouse-based gesture; see [d3-drag#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br> Only applies immediately after some mouse-based gestures; see [*zoom*.clickDistance](#zoom_clickDistance).
<br> Necessary to allow [click emulation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006511-SW7) on touch input; see [d3-drag#9](https://github.com/d3/d3-drag/issues/9).
<br> Ignored if within 500ms of a touch gesture ending; assumes [click emulation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006511-SW7).
<br> Double-click and double-tap initiate a transition that emits start, zoom and end events.
<br> The first wheel event emits a start event; an end event is emitted when no wheel events are received for 150ms.
<br> Ignored if already at the corresponding limit of the [scale extent](#zoom_scaleExtent).

Applies this zoom behavior to the specified [*selection*](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection), binding the necessary event listeners to allow panning and zooming, and initializing the [zoom transform](#zoom-transforms) on each selected element to the identity transform if not already defined. This function is typically not invoked directly, and is instead invoked via [*selection*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_call). For example, to instantiate a zoom behavior and apply it to a selection:

```js
selection.call(d3.zoom().on("zoom", zoomed));
```

Internally, the zoom behavior uses [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) to bind the necessary event listeners for zooming. The listeners use the name `.zoom`, so you can subsequently unbind the zoom behavior as follows:

```js
selection.on(".zoom", null);
```

To disable just wheel-driven zooming (say to not interfere with native scrolling), you can remove the zoom behaviors wheel event listener after applying the zoom behavior to the selection:

```js
selection
    .call(zoom)
    .on("wheel.zoom", null);
```

Alternatively, use [*zoom*.filter](#zoom_filter) for greater control over which events can initiate zoom gestures.

Applying the zoom behavior also sets the [-webkit-tap-highlight-color](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/AdjustingtheTextSize/AdjustingtheTextSize.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006510-SW5) style to transparent, disabling the tap highlight on iOS. If you want a different tap highlight color, remove or re-apply this style after applying the drag behavior.

<a href="#zoom_transform" name="zoom_transform">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>transform</b>(<i>selection</i>, <i>transform</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L75 "Source")

If *selection* is a selection, sets the [current zoom transform](#zoomTransform) of the selected elements to the specified *transform*, instantaneously emitting start, zoom and end [events](#zoom-events). If *selection* is a transition, defines a zoom tween to the specified *transform* using [d3.interpolateZoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateZoom), emitting a start event when the transition starts, zoom events for each tick of the transition, and then an end event when the transition ends (or is interrupted). The *transform* may be specified either as a [zoom transform](#zoom-transforms) or as a function that returns a zoom transform. If a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

This function is typically not invoked directly, and is instead invoked via [*selection*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_call) or [*transition*.call](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition#transition_call). For example, to reset the zoom transform to the [identity transform](#zoomIdentity) instantaneously:

```js
selection.call(zoom.transform, d3.zoomIdentity);
```

To smoothly reset the zoom transform to the identity transform over 750 milliseconds:

```js
selection.transition().duration(750).call(zoom.transform, d3.zoomIdentity);
```

This method requires that you specify the new zoom transform completely, and does not enforce the defined [scale extent](#zoom_scaleExtent) and [translate extent](#zoom_translateExtent), if any. To derive a new transform from the existing transform, and to enforce the scale and translate extents, see the convenience methods [*zoom*.translateBy](#zoom_translateBy), [*zoom*.scaleBy](#zoom_scaleBy) and [*zoom*.scaleTo](#zoom_scaleTo).

<a href="#zoom_translateBy" name="zoom_translateBy">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>translateBy</b>(<i>selection</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L109 "Source")

If *selection* is a selection, [translates](#transform_translate) the [current zoom transform](#zoomTransform) of the selected elements by *x* and *y*, such that the new *t<sub>x1</sub>* = *t<sub>x0</sub>* + *kx* and *t<sub>y1</sub>* = *t<sub>y0</sub>* + *ky*. If *selection* is a transition, defines a zoom tween translating the current transform. This method is a convenience method for [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform). The *x* and *y* translation amounts may be specified either as numbers or as functions that returns numbers. If a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

<a href="#zoom_translateTo" name="zoom_translateTo">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>translateTo</b>(<i>selection</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L118 "Source")

If *selection* is a selection, [translates](#transform_translate) the [current zoom transform](#zoomTransform) of the selected elements such that the specified position *x*,*y* appears at the center of the [viewport extent](#zoom_extent). The new *t<sub>x</sub>* = *c<sub>x</sub>* - *kx* and *t<sub>y</sub>* = *c<sub>y</sub>* - *ky*, where *c<sub>x</sub>*,*c<sub>y</sub>* is the center. If *selection* is a transition, defines a zoom tween translating the current transform. This method is a convenience method for [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform). The *x* and *y* coordinates may be specified either as numbers or as functions that returns numbers. If a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

<a href="#zoom_scaleBy" name="zoom_scaleBy">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>scaleBy</b>(<i>selection</i>, <i>k</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L90 "Source")

If *selection* is a selection, [scales](#transform_scale) the [current zoom transform](#zoomTransform) of the selected elements by *k*, such that the new *k* = *kk*. If *selection* is a transition, defines a zoom tween translating the current transform. This method is a convenience method for [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform). The *k* scale factor may be specified either as numbers or as functions that returns numbers. If a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

<a href="#zoom_scaleTo" name="zoom_scaleTo">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>scaleTo</b>(<i>selection</i>, <i>k</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L98 "Source")

If *selection* is a selection, [scales](#transform_scale) the [current zoom transform](#zoomTransform) of the selected elements to *k*, such that the new *k* = *k*. If *selection* is a transition, defines a zoom tween translating the current transform. This method is a convenience method for [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform). The *k* scale factor may be specified either as numbers or as functions that returns numbers. If a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

<a href="#zoom_filter" name="zoom_filter">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>filter</b>([<i>filter</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L373 "Source")

If *filter* is specified, sets the filter to the specified function and returns the zoom behavior. If *filter* is not specified, returns the current filter, which defaults to:

```js
function filter() {
  return !d3.event.button;
}
```

If the filter returns falsey, the initiating event is ignored and no zoom gestures are started. Thus, the filter determines which input events are ignored. The default filter ignores mousedown events on secondary buttons, since those buttons are typically intended for other purposes, such as the context menu.

<a href="#zoom_wheelDelta" name="zoom_wheelDelta">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>wheelDelta</b>([<i>delta</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L369 "Source")

If *delta* is specified, sets the wheel delta function to the specified function and returns the zoom behavior. If *delta* is not specified, returns the current wheel delta function, which defaults to:

```js
function wheelDelta() {
  return -d3.event.deltaY * (d3.event.deltaMode ? 120 : 1) / 500;
}
```

The value ** returned by the wheel delta function determines the amount of scaling applied in response to a [WheelEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent). The scale factor [*transform*.k](#zoomTransform) is multiplied by 2<sup>**</sup>; for example, a ** of +1 doubles the scale factor, ** of -1 halves the scale factor.

<a href="#zoom_extent" name="zoom_extent">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>extent</b>([<i>extent</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L377 "Source")

If *extent* is specified, sets the viewport extent to the specified array of points [[*x0*, *y0*], [*x1*, *y1*]], where [*x0*, *y0*] is the top-left corner of the viewport and [*x1*, *y1*] is the bottom-right corner of the viewport, and returns this zoom behavior. The *extent* may also be specified as a function which returns such an array; if a function, it is invoked for each selected element, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

If *extent* is not specified, returns the current extent accessor, which defaults to [[0, 0], [*width*, *height*]] where *width* is the [client width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientWidth) of the element and *height* is its [client height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientHeight); for SVG elements, the nearest ancestor SVG elements [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElementWidthAttribute) and [height](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElementHeightAttribute) is used. In this case, the owner SVG element must have defined [width](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElementWidthAttribute) and [height](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#SVGElementHeightAttribute) attributes rather than (for example) relying on CSS properties or the viewBox attribute; SVG provides no programmatic method for retrieving the [initial viewport size](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#ViewportSpace). Alternatively, consider using [*element*.getBoundingClientRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect). (In Firefox, [*element*.clientWidth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientWidth) and [*element*.clientHeight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientHeight) is zero for SVG elements!)

The viewport extent affects several functions: the center of the viewport remains fixed during changes by [*zoom*.scaleBy](#zoom_scaleBy) and [*zoom*.scaleTo](#zoom_scaleTo); the viewport center and dimensions affect the path chosen by [d3.interpolateZoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateZoom); and the viewport extent is needed to enforce the optional [translate extent](#zoom_translateExtent.)

<a href="#zoom_scaleExtent" name="zoom_scaleExtent">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>scaleExtent</b>([<i>extent</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L381 "Source")

If *extent* is specified, sets the scale extent to the specified array of numbers [*k0*, *k1*] where *k0* is the minimum allowed scale factor and *k1* is the maximum allowed scale factor, and returns this zoom behavior. If *extent* is not specified, returns the current scale extent, which defaults to [0, ]. The scale extent restricts zooming in and out. It is enforced on interaction and when using [*zoom*.scaleBy](#zoom_scaleBy), [*zoom*.scaleTo](#zoom_scaleTo) and [*zoom*.translateBy](#zoom_translateBy); however, it is not enforced when using [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform) to set the transform explicitly.

If the user tries to zoom by wheeling when already at the corresponding limit of the scale extent, the wheel events will be ignored and not initiate a zoom gesture. This allows the user to scroll down past a zoomable area after zooming in, or to scroll up after zooming out. If you would prefer to always prevent scrolling on wheel input regardless of the scale extent, register a wheel event listener to prevent the browser default behavior:

```js
selection
    .call(zoom)
    .on("wheel", function() { d3.event.preventDefault(); });
```

<a href="#zoom_translateExtent" name="zoom_translateExtent">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>translateExtent</b>([<i>extent</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L385 "Source")

If *extent* is specified, sets the translate extent to the specified array of points [[*x0*, *y0*], [*x1*, *y1*]], where [*x0*, *y0*] is the top-left corner of the world and [*x1*, *y1*] is the bottom-right corner of the world, and returns this zoom behavior. If *extent* is not specified, returns the current translate extent, which defaults to [[-, -], [+, +]]. The translate extent restricts panning, and may cause translation on zoom out. It is enforced on interaction and when using [*zoom*.scaleBy](#zoom_scaleBy), [*zoom*.scaleTo](#zoom_scaleTo) and [*zoom*.translateBy](#zoom_translateBy); however, it is not enforced when using [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform) to set the transform explicitly.

<a href="#zoom_clickDistance" name="zoom_clickDistance">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>clickDistance</b>([<i>distance</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L402 "Source")

If *distance* is specified, sets the maximum distance that the mouse can move between mousedown and mouseup that will trigger a subsequent click event. If at any point between mousedown and mouseup the mouse is greater than or equal to *distance* from its position on mousedown, the click event follwing mouseup will be suppressed. If *distance* is not specified, returns the current distance threshold, which defaults to zero. The distance threshold is measured in client coordinates ([*event*.clientX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/clientX) and [*event*.clientY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/clientY)).

<a href="#zoom_duration" name="zoom_duration">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>duration</b>([<i>duration</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L389 "Source")

If *duration* is specified, sets the duration for zoom transitions on double-click and double-tap to the specified number of milliseconds and returns the zoom behavior. If *duration* is not specified, returns the current duration, which defaults to 250 milliseconds. If the duration is not greater than zero, double-click and -tap trigger instantaneous changes to the zoom transform rather than initiating smooth transitions.

To disable double-click and double-tap transitions, you can remove the zoom behaviors dblclick event listener after applying the zoom behavior to the selection:

```js
selection
    .call(zoom)
    .on("dblclick.zoom", null);
```

<a href="#zoom_interpolate" name="zoom_interpolate">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>interpolate</b>([<i>interpolate</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L393 "Source")

If *interpolate* is specified, sets the interpolation factory for zoom transitions to the specified function. If *interpolate* is not specified, returns the current interpolation factory, which defaults to [d3.interpolateZoom](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateZoom) to implement smooth zooming. To apply direct interpolation between two views, try [d3.interpolate](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolate) instead.

<a href="#zoom_on" name="zoom_on">#</a> <i>zoom</i>.<b>on</b>(<i>typenames</i>[, <i>listener</i>]) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/zoom.js#L397 "Source")

If *listener* is specified, sets the event *listener* for the specified *typenames* and returns the zoom behavior. If an event listener was already registered for the same type and name, the existing listener is removed before the new listener is added. If *listener* is null, removes the current event listeners for the specified *typenames*, if any. If *listener* is not specified, returns the first currently-assigned listener matching the specified *typenames*, if any. When a specified event is dispatched, each *listener* will be invoked with the same context and arguments as [*selection*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on) listeners: the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.

The *typenames* is a string containing one or more *typename* separated by whitespace. Each *typename* is a *type*, optionally followed by a period (`.`) and a *name*, such as `zoom.foo` and `zoom.bar`; the name allows multiple listeners to be registered for the same *type*. The *type* must be one of the following:

* `start` - after zooming begins (such as on mousedown).
* `zoom` - after a change to the zoom transform (such as on mousemove).
* `end` - after zooming ends (such as on mouseup ).

See [*dispatch*.on](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch#dispatch_on) for more.

### Zoom Events

When a [zoom event listener](#zoom_on) is invoked, [d3.event](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#event) is set to the current zoom event. The *event* object exposes several fields:

* *event*.target - the associated [zoom behavior](#zoom).
* *event*.type - the string start, zoom or end; see [*zoom*.on](#zoom_on).
* *event*.transform - the current [zoom transform](#zoom-transforms).
* *event*.sourceEvent - the underlying input event, such as mousemove or touchmove.

### Zoom Transforms

The zoom behavior stores the zoom state on the element to which the zoom behavior was [applied](#_zoom), not on the zoom behavior itself. This is because the zoom behavior can be applied to many elements simultaneously, and each element can be zoomed independently. The zoom state can change either on user interaction or programmatically via [*zoom*.transform](#zoom_transform).

To retrieve the zoom state, use *event*.transform on the current [zoom event](#zoom-events) within a zoom event listener (see [*zoom*.on](#zoom_on)), or use [d3.zoomTransform](#zoomTransform) for a given node. The latter is particularly useful for modifying the zoom state programmatically, say to implement buttons for zooming in and out.

<a href="#zoomTransform" name="zoomTransform">#</a> d3.<b>zoomTransform</b>(<i>node</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js "Source")

Returns the current transform for the specified *node*. Note that *node* should typically be a DOM element, not a *selection*. (A selection may consist of multiple nodes, in different states, and this function only returns a single transform.) If you have a selection, call [*selection*.node](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_node) first:

```js
var transform = d3.zoomTransform(selection.node());
```

In the context of an [event listener](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_on), the *node* is typically the element that received the input event (which should be equal to [*event*.transform](#zoom-events)), *this*:

```js
var transform = d3.zoomTransform(this);
```

Internally, an elements transform is stored as *element*.\_\_zoom; however, you should use this method rather than accessing it directly. If the given *node* has no defined transform, returns the [identity transformation](#zoomIdentity). The returned transform represents a two-dimensional [transformation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix#Affine_transformations) of the form:

*k* 0 *t<sub>x</sub>*
<br>0 *k* *t<sub>y</sub>*
<br>0 0 1

(This matrix is capable of representing only scale and translation; a future release may also allow rotation, though this would probably not be a backwards-compatible change.) The position *x*,*y* is transformed to *xk* + *t<sub>x</sub>*,*yk* + *t<sub>y</sub>*. The transform object exposes the following properties:

* *transform*.x - the translation amount *t<sub>x</sub>* along the *x*-axis.
* *transform*.y - the translation amount *t<sub>y</sub>* along the *y*-axis.
* *transform*.k - the scale factor *k*.

These properties should be considered read-only; instead of mutating a transform, use [*transform*.scale](#transform_scale) and [*transform*.translate](#transform_translate) to derive a new transform. Also see [*zoom*.scaleBy](#zoom_scaleBy), [*zoom*.scaleTo](#zoom_scaleTo) and [*zoom*.translateBy](#zoom_translateBy) for convenience methods on the zoom behavior. To create a transform with a given *k*, *t<sub>x</sub>*, and *t<sub>y</sub>*:

```js
var t = d3.zoomIdentity.translate(x, y).scale(k);
```

To apply the transformation to a [Canvas 2D context](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/), use [*context*.translate](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#dom-context-2d-translate) followed by [*context*.scale](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#dom-context-2d-scale):

```js
context.translate(transform.x, transform.y);
context.scale(transform.k, transform.k);
```

Similarly, to apply the transformation to HTML elements via [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/):

```js
div.style("transform", "translate(" + transform.x + "px," + transform.y + "px) scale(" + transform.k + ")");
div.style("transform-origin", "0 0");
```

To apply the transformation to [SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute):

```js
g.attr("transform", "translate(" + transform.x + "," + transform.y + ") scale(" + transform.k + ")");
```

Or more simply, taking advantage of [*transform*.toString](#transform_toString):

```js
g.attr("transform", transform);
```

Note that the order of transformations matters! The translate must be applied before the scale.

<a href="#transform_scale" name="transform_scale">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>scale</b>(<i>k</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L9 "Source")

<a href="#transform_translate" name="transform_translate">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>translate</b>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L12 "Source")

Returns a transform whose translation *t<sub>x1</sub>* and *t<sub>y1</sub>* is equal to *t<sub>x0</sub>* + *x* and *t<sub>y0</sub>* + *y*, where *t<sub>x0</sub>* and *t<sub>y0</sub>* is this transforms translation.

<a href="#transform_apply" name="transform_apply">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>apply</b>(<i>point</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L15 "Source")

Returns the transformation of the specified *point* which is a two-element array of numbers [*x*, *y*]. The returned point is equal to [*xk* + *t<sub>x</sub>*, *yk* + *t<sub>y</sub>*].

<a href="#transform_applyX" name="transform_applyX">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>applyX</b>(<i>x</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L18 "Source")

Returns the transformation of the specified *x*-coordinate, *xk* + *t<sub>x</sub>*.

<a href="#transform_applyY" name="transform_applyY">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>applyY</b>(<i>y</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L21 "Source")

Returns the transformation of the specified *y*-coordinate, *yk* + *t<sub>y</sub>*.

<a href="#transform_invert" name="transform_invert">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>invert</b>(<i>point</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L24 "Source")

Returns the inverse transformation of the specified *point* which is a two-element array of numbers [*x*, *y*]. The returned point is equal to [(*x* - *t<sub>x</sub>*) / *k*, (*y* - *t<sub>y</sub>*) / *k*].

<a href="#transform_invertX" name="transform_invertX">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>invertX</b>(<i>x</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L27 "Source")

<a href="#transform_invertY" name="transform_invertY">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>invertY</b>(<i>y</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L30 "Source")

Returns the inverse transformation of the specified *y*-coordinate, (*y* - *t<sub>y</sub>*) / *k*.

<a href="#transform_rescaleX" name="transform_rescaleX">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>rescaleX</b>(<i>x</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L33 "Source")

Returns a [copy](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_copy) of the [continuous scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous-scales) *x* whose [domain](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_domain) is transformed. This is implemented by first applying the [inverse *x*-transform](#transform_invertX) on the scales [range](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_range), and then applying the [inverse scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_invert) to compute the corresponding domain:

```js
function rescaleX(x) {
  var range = x.range().map(transform.invertX, transform),
      domain = range.map(x.invert, x);
  return x.copy().domain(domain);
}
```

The scale *x* must use [d3.interpolateNumber](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateNumber); do not use [*continuous*.rangeRound](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_rangeRound) as this reduces the accuracy of [*continuous*.invert](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_invert) and can lead to an inaccurate rescaled domain. This method does not modify the input scale *x*; *x* thus represents the untransformed scale, while the returned scale represents its transformed view.

<a href="#transform_rescaleY" name="transform_rescaleY">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>rescaleY</b>(<i>y</i>) [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L36 "Source")

Returns a [copy](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_copy) of the [continuous scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous-scales) *y* whose [domain](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_domain) is transformed. This is implemented by first applying the [inverse *y*-transform](#transform_invertY) on the scales [range](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_range), and then applying the [inverse scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_invert) to compute the corresponding domain:

```js
function rescaleY(y) {
  var range = y.range().map(transform.invertY, transform),
      domain = range.map(y.invert, y);
  return y.copy().domain(domain);
}
```

The scale *y* must use [d3.interpolateNumber](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate#interpolateNumber); do not use [*continuous*.rangeRound](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_rangeRound) as this reduces the accuracy of [*continuous*.invert](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale#continuous_invert) and can lead to an inaccurate rescaled domain. This method does not modify the input scale *y*; *y* thus represents the untransformed scale, while the returned scale represents its transformed view.

<a href="#transform_toString" name="transform_toString">#</a> <i>transform</i>.<b>toString</b>() [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L39 "Source")

Returns a string representing the [SVG transform](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformAttribute) corresponding to this transform. Implemented as:

```js
function toString() {
  return "translate(" + this.x + "," + this.y + ") scale(" + this.k + ")";
}
```

<a href="#zoomIdentity" name="zoomIdentity">#</a> d3.<b>zoomIdentity</b> [<>](https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom/blob/master/src/transform.js#L44 "Source")

The identity transform, where *k* = 1, *t<sub>x</sub>* = *t<sub>y</sub>* = 0.

## Pure JS character encoding conversion [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite)

 * Doesn't need native code compilation. Works on Windows and in sandboxed environments like [Cloud9](http://c9.io).
 * Used in popular projects like [Express.js (body_parser)](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser), 
   [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Nodemailer](http://www.nodemailer.com/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and others.
 * Faster than [node-iconv](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv) (see below for performance comparison).
 * Intuitive encode/decode API
 * Streaming support for Node v0.10+
 * [Deprecated] Can extend Node.js primitives (buffers, streams) to support all iconv-lite encodings.
 * In-browser usage via [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) (~180k gzip compressed with Buffer shim included).
 * Typescript [type definition file](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/blob/master/lib/index.d.ts) included.
 * React Native is supported (need to explicitly `npm install` two more modules: `buffer` and `stream`).
 * License: MIT.

[![NPM Stats](https://nodei.co/npm/iconv-lite.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://npmjs.org/packages/iconv-lite/)

## Usage
### Basic API
```javascript
var iconv = require('iconv-lite');

// Convert from an encoded buffer to js string.
str = iconv.decode(Buffer.from([0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]), 'win1251');

// Convert from js string to an encoded buffer.
buf = iconv.encode("Sample input string", 'win1251');

// Check if encoding is supported
iconv.encodingExists("us-ascii")
```

### Streaming API (Node v0.10+)
```javascript

// Decode stream (from binary stream to js strings)
http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    var converterStream = iconv.decodeStream('win1251');
    req.pipe(converterStream);

    converterStream.on('data', function(str) {
        console.log(str); // Do something with decoded strings, chunk-by-chunk.
    });
});

// Convert encoding streaming example
fs.createReadStream('file-in-win1251.txt')
    .pipe(iconv.decodeStream('win1251'))
    .pipe(iconv.encodeStream('ucs2'))
    .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('file-in-ucs2.txt'));

// Sugar: all encode/decode streams have .collect(cb) method to accumulate data.
http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    req.pipe(iconv.decodeStream('win1251')).collect(function(err, body) {
        assert(typeof body == 'string');
        console.log(body); // full request body string
    });
});
```

### [Deprecated] Extend Node.js own encodings
> NOTE: This doesn't work on latest Node versions. See [details](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/wiki/Node-v4-compatibility).

```javascript
// After this call all Node basic primitives will understand iconv-lite encodings.
iconv.extendNodeEncodings();

// Examples:
buf = new Buffer(str, 'win1251');
buf.write(str, 'gbk');
str = buf.toString('latin1');
assert(Buffer.isEncoding('iso-8859-15'));
Buffer.byteLength(str, 'us-ascii');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    req.setEncoding('big5');
    req.collect(function(err, body) {
        console.log(body);
    });
});

fs.createReadStream("file.txt", "shift_jis");

// External modules are also supported (if they use Node primitives, which they probably do).
request = require('request');
request({
    url: "http://github.com/", 
    encoding: "cp932"
});

// To remove extensions
iconv.undoExtendNodeEncodings();
```

## Supported encodings

 *  All node.js native encodings: utf8, ucs2 / utf16-le, ascii, binary, base64, hex.
 *  Additional unicode encodings: utf16, utf16-be, utf-7, utf-7-imap.
 *  All widespread singlebyte encodings: Windows 125x family, ISO-8859 family, 
    IBM/DOS codepages, Macintosh family, KOI8 family, all others supported by iconv library. 
    Aliases like 'latin1', 'us-ascii' also supported.
 *  All widespread multibyte encodings: CP932, CP936, CP949, CP950, GB2312, GBK, GB18030, Big5, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP.

See [all supported encodings on wiki](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/wiki/Supported-Encodings).

Most singlebyte encodings are generated automatically from [node-iconv](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv). Thank you Ben Noordhuis and libiconv authors!

Multibyte encodings are generated from [Unicode.org mappings](http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/) and [WHATWG Encoding Standard mappings](http://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/). Thank you, respective authors!


## Encoding/decoding speed

Comparison with node-iconv module (1000x256kb, on MacBook Pro, Core i5/2.6 GHz, Node v0.12.0). 
Note: your results may vary, so please always check on your hardware.

    operation             iconv@2.1.4   iconv-lite@0.4.7
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    encode('win1251')     ~96 Mb/s      ~320 Mb/s
    decode('win1251')     ~95 Mb/s      ~246 Mb/s

## BOM handling

 * Decoding: BOM is stripped by default, unless overridden by passing `stripBOM: false` in options
   (f.ex. `iconv.decode(buf, enc, {stripBOM: false})`).
   A callback might also be given as a `stripBOM` parameter - it'll be called if BOM character was actually found.
 * If you want to detect UTF-8 BOM when decoding other encodings, use [node-autodetect-decoder-stream](https://github.com/danielgindi/node-autodetect-decoder-stream) module.
 * Encoding: No BOM added, unless overridden by `addBOM: true` option.

## UTF-16 Encodings

This library supports UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE and UTF-16 encodings. First two are straightforward, but UTF-16 is trying to be
smart about endianness in the following ways:
 * Decoding: uses BOM and 'spaces heuristic' to determine input endianness. Default is UTF-16LE, but can be 
   overridden with `defaultEncoding: 'utf-16be'` option. Strips BOM unless `stripBOM: false`.
 * Encoding: uses UTF-16LE and writes BOM by default. Use `addBOM: false` to override.

## Other notes

When decoding, be sure to supply a Buffer to decode() method, otherwise [bad things usually happen](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/wiki/Use-Buffers-when-decoding).  
Untranslatable characters are set to  or ?. No transliteration is currently supported.  
Node versions 0.10.31 and 0.11.13 are buggy, don't use them (see #65, #77).  

## Testing

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ashtuchkin/iconv-lite.git
$ cd iconv-lite
$ npm install
$ npm test
    
$ # To view performance:
$ node test/performance.js

File: ./node_modules/rw/README.md
# rw - Now stdin and stdout are files.

How do you read a file from stdin? If you thought,

```js
var contents = fs.readFileSync("/dev/stdin", "utf8");
```

youd be wrong, because Node only reads up to the size of the file reported by fs.stat rather than reading until it receives an EOF. So, if you redirect a file to your program (`cat file | program`), youll only read the first 65,536 bytes of your file. Oops.

What about writing a file to stdout? If you thought,

```js
fs.writeFileSync("/dev/stdout", contents, "utf8");
```

youd also be wrong, because this tries to close stdout, so you get this error:

```
Error: UNKNOWN, unknown error
    at Object.fs.writeSync (fs.js:528:18)
    at Object.fs.writeFileSync (fs.js:975:21)
```

(Also, this doesnt work on Windows, because Windows doesnt support /dev/stdout, /dev/stdin and /dev/stderr!)

Shucks. So what should you do?

You could use a different pattern for reading from stdin:

```js
var chunks = [];

process.stdin
    .on("data", function(chunk) { chunks.push(chunk); })
    .on("end", function() { console.log(chunks.join("").length); })
    .setEncoding("utf8");
```

But thats a pain, since now your code has two different code paths for reading inputs depending on whether youre reading a real file or stdin. And the code gets even more complex if you want to [read that file synchronously](https://github.com/mbostock/rw/blob/master/lib/rw/read-file-sync.js).

You could also try a different pattern for writing to stdout:

```js
process.stdout.write(contents);
```

Or even:

```js
console.log(contents);
```

But if you try to pipe your output to `head`, youll get this error:

```
Error: write EPIPE
    at errnoException (net.js:904:11)
    at Object.afterWrite (net.js:720:19)
```

Huh.

The **rw** module fixes these problems. It provides an interface just like readFile, readFileSync, writeFile and writeFileSync, but with implementations that work the way you expect on stdin and stdout. If you use these methods on files other than /dev/stdin or /dev/stdout, they simply delegate to the fs methods, so you can trust that they behave identically to the methods youre used to.

For example, now you can read stdin synchronously like so:

```js
var contents = rw.readFileSync("/dev/stdin", "utf8");
```

Or to write to stdout:

```js
rw.writeFileSync("/dev/stdout", contents, "utf8");
```

And rw automatically squashes EPIPE errors, so you can pipe the output of your program to `head` and you wont get a spurious stack trace.

To install, `npm install rw`.

### Note

If you want to read synchronously from stdin using [readFileSync](#readFileSync), you cannot also use process.stdin in the same program. Likewise, if you want to write synchronously to stdout or stderr using [writeFileSync](#writeFileSync), you cannot use process.stdout or process.stderr, respectively. (This includes using console.log and the like!) Failure to heed this warning may result in error: EAGAIN, resource temporarily unavailable. Unfortunately, it does not appear possible for this library to fix this issue automatically, so please use caution.

Only the asynchronous methods [readFile](#readFile) and [writeFile](#writeFile) are supported on Windows. Node has no synchronous API for reading from process.[stdin](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stdin) or writing to process.[stdout](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stdout) or process.[stderr](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stderr), so youre out of luck!

## API Reference

<a name="readFile" href="#readFile">#</a> rw.<b>readFile</b>(<i>path</i>[, <i>options</i>], <i>callback</i>)

Reads the file at the specified *path* completely into memory, invoking the specified *callback* once the data is available and the file is closed. The *callback* is invoked with two arguments: the *error* that occurred during read (hopefully null), and the read data. If *options* is a string, it specifies the encoding to use, in which case the read data will be a string; otherwise *options* is an object, and may specify encoding and flag properties. This method is a drop-in replacement for [fs.readFile](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_file_options_callback) and fixes the behavior of special files such as /dev/stdin.

<a name="readFileSync" href="#readFileSync">#</a> rw.<b>readFileSync</b>(<i>path</i>[, <i>options</i>])

Reads the file at the specified *path* completely into memory, synchronously, returning the data. If an error occurred during read, this function throws an error instead. If *options* is a string, it specifies the encoding to use, in which case the read data will be a string; otherwise *options* is an object, and may specify encoding and flag properties. This method is a drop-in replacement for [fs.readFileSync](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_file_options) and fixes the behavior of special files such as /dev/stdin.

<a name="writeFile" href="#writeFile">#</a> rw.<b>writeFile</b>(<i>path</i>, <i>data</i>[, <i>options</i>], <i>callback</i>)

Writes the specified *data* (completely in memory) to a file at the specified *path*, invoking the specified *callback* once the data is completely written and the file is closed. The *callback* is invoked with a single argument: the *error* that occurred during write (hopefully null). If *options* is a string, it specifies the encoding to use, in which case the *data* must be a string; otherwise *options* is an object, and may specify encoding, mode and flag properties. This method is a drop-in replacement for [fs.writeFile](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback) and fixes the behavior of special files such as /dev/stdout.

<a name="writeFileSync" href="#writeFileSync">#</a> rw.<b>writeFileSync</b>(<i>path</i>, <i>data</i>[, <i>options</i>])

Writes the specified *data* (completely in memory) to a file at the specified *path*, synchronously, returning once the data is completely written and the file is closed. Throws an *error* if one occurs during write. If *options* is a string, it specifies the encoding to use, in which case the *data* must be a string; otherwise *options* is an object, and may specify encoding, mode and flag properties. This method is a drop-in replacement for [fs.writeFileSync](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefilesync_file_data_options) and fixes the behavior of special files such as /dev/stdout.

<a name="dash_readFile" href="#dash_readFile">#</a> rw.dash.<b>readFile</b>(<i>path</i>[, <i>options</i>], <i>callback</i>)

Equivalent to [rw.readFile](#readFile), except treats a *path* of `-` as `/dev/stdin`. Useful for command-line arguments.

<a name="dash_readFileSync" href="#dash_readFileSync">#</a> rw.dash.<b>readFileSync</b>(<i>path</i>[, <i>options</i>])

Equivalent to [rw.readFileSync](#readFileSync), except treats a *path* of `-` as `/dev/stdin`. Useful for command-line arguments.

<a name="dash_writeFile" href="#dash_writeFile">#</a> rw.dash.<b>writeFile</b>(<i>path</i>, <i>data</i>[, <i>options</i>], <i>callback</i>)

Equivalent to [rw.writeFile](#writeFile), except treats a *path* of `-` as `/dev/stdout`. Useful for command-line arguments.

<a name="dash_writeFileSync" href="#dash_writeFileSync">#</a> rw.dash.<b>writeFileSync</b>(<i>path</i>, <i>data</i>[, <i>options</i>])

Equivalent to [rw.writeFileSync](#writeFileSync), except treats a *path* of `-` as `/dev/stdout`. Useful for command-line arguments.

# Porting to the Buffer.from/Buffer.alloc API

<a id="overview"></a>
## Overview

- [Variant 1: Drop support for Node.js  4.4.x and 5.0.0  5.9.x.](#variant-1) (*recommended*)
- [Variant 2: Use a polyfill](#variant-2)
- [Variant 3: manual detection, with safeguards](#variant-3)

### Finding problematic bits of code using grep

Just run `grep -nrE '[^a-zA-Z](Slow)?Buffer\s*\(' --exclude-dir node_modules`.

It will find all the potentially unsafe places in your own code (with some considerably unlikely
exceptions).

### Finding problematic bits of code using Node.js 8

If youre using Node.js  8.0.0 (which is recommended), Node.js exposes multiple options that help with finding the relevant pieces of code:

- `--trace-warnings` will make Node.js show a stack trace for this warning and other warnings that are printed by Node.js.
- `--trace-deprecation` does the same thing, but only for deprecation warnings.
- `--pending-deprecation` will show more types of deprecation warnings. In particular, it will show the `Buffer()` deprecation warning, even on Node.js 8.

You can set these flags using an environment variable:

```console
$ export NODE_OPTIONS='--trace-warnings --pending-deprecation'
$ cat example.js
'use strict';
const foo = new Buffer('foo');
$ node example.js
(node:7147) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: The Buffer() and new Buffer() constructors are not recommended for use due to security and usability concerns. Please use the new Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() construction methods instead.
    at showFlaggedDeprecation (buffer.js:127:13)
    at new Buffer (buffer.js:148:3)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/path/to/example.js:2:13)
    [... more stack trace lines ...]
```

### Finding problematic bits of code using linters

Eslint rules [no-buffer-constructor](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-buffer-constructor)
or
[node/no-deprecated-api](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-deprecated-api.md)
also find calls to deprecated `Buffer()` API. Those rules are included in some pre-sets.

There is a drawback, though, that it doesn't always
[work correctly](https://github.com/chalker/safer-buffer#why-not-safe-buffer) when `Buffer` is
overriden e.g. with a polyfill, so recommended is a combination of this and some other method
described above.

<a id="variant-1"></a>
## Variant 1: Drop support for Node.js  4.4.x and 5.0.0  5.9.x.

This is the recommended solution nowadays that would imply only minimal overhead.

The Node.js 5.x release line has been unsupported since July 2016, and the Node.js 4.x release line reaches its End of Life in April 2018 ( [Schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule)). This means that these versions of Node.js will *not* receive any updates, even in case of security issues, so using these release lines should be avoided, if at all possible.

What you would do in this case is to convert all `new Buffer()` or `Buffer()` calls to use `Buffer.alloc()` or `Buffer.from()`, in the following way:

- For `new Buffer(number)`, replace it with `Buffer.alloc(number)`.
- For `new Buffer(string)` (or `new Buffer(string, encoding)`), replace it with `Buffer.from(string)` (or `Buffer.from(string, encoding)`).
- For all other combinations of arguments (these are much rarer), also replace `new Buffer(...arguments)` with `Buffer.from(...arguments)`.

Note that `Buffer.alloc()` is also _faster_ on the current Node.js versions than
`new Buffer(size).fill(0)`, which is what you would otherwise need to ensure zero-filling.

Enabling eslint rule [no-buffer-constructor](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-buffer-constructor)
or
[node/no-deprecated-api](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-deprecated-api.md)
is recommended to avoid accidential unsafe Buffer API usage.

There is also a [JSCodeshift codemod](https://github.com/joyeecheung/node-dep-codemod#dep005)
for automatically migrating Buffer constructors to `Buffer.alloc()` or `Buffer.from()`.
Note that it currently only works with cases where the arguments are literals or where the
constructor is invoked with two arguments.

_If you currently support those older Node.js versions and dropping them would be a semver-major change
for you, or if you support older branches of your packages, consider using [Variant 2](#variant-2)
or [Variant 3](#variant-3) on older branches, so people using those older branches will also receive
the fix. That way, you will eradicate potential issues caused by unguarded Buffer API usage and
your users will not observe a runtime deprecation warning when running your code on Node.js 10._

<a id="variant-2"></a>
## Variant 2: Use a polyfill

Utilize [safer-buffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safer-buffer) as a polyfill to support older
Node.js versions.

You would take exacly the same steps as in [Variant 1](#variant-1), but with a polyfill
`const Buffer = require('safer-buffer').Buffer` in all files where you use the new `Buffer` api.

Make sure that you do not use old `new Buffer` API  in any files where the line above is added,
using old `new Buffer()` API will _throw_. It will be easy to notice that in CI, though.

Alternatively, you could use [buffer-from](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer-from) and/or
[buffer-alloc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer-alloc) [ponyfills](https://ponyfill.com/) 
those are great, the only downsides being 4 deps in the tree and slightly more code changes to
migrate off them (as you would be using e.g. `Buffer.from` under a different name). If you need only
`Buffer.from` polyfilled  `buffer-from` alone which comes with no extra dependencies.

_Alternatively, you could use [safe-buffer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-buffer)  it also
provides a polyfill, but takes a different approach which has
[it's drawbacks](https://github.com/chalker/safer-buffer#why-not-safe-buffer). It will allow you
to also use the older `new Buffer()` API in your code, though  but that's arguably a benefit, as
it is problematic, can cause issues in your code, and will start emitting runtime deprecation
warnings starting with Node.js 10._

Note that in either case, it is important that you also remove all calls to the old Buffer
API manually  just throwing in `safe-buffer` doesn't fix the problem by itself, it just provides
a polyfill for the new API. I have seen people doing that mistake.

Enabling eslint rule [no-buffer-constructor](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-buffer-constructor)
or
[node/no-deprecated-api](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-deprecated-api.md)
is recommended.

_Don't forget to drop the polyfill usage once you drop support for Node.js < 4.5.0._

<a id="variant-3"></a>
## Variant 3  manual detection, with safeguards

This is useful if you create Buffer instances in only a few places (e.g. one), or you have your own
wrapper around them.

### Buffer(0)

This special case for creating empty buffers can be safely replaced with `Buffer.concat([])`, which
returns the same result all the way down to Node.js 0.8.x.

### Buffer(notNumber)

Before:

```js
var buf = new Buffer(notNumber, encoding);
```

After:

```js
var buf;
if (Buffer.from && Buffer.from !== Uint8Array.from) {
  buf = Buffer.from(notNumber, encoding);
} else {
  if (typeof notNumber === 'number')
    throw new Error('The "size" argument must be of type number.');
  buf = new Buffer(notNumber, encoding);
}
```

`encoding` is optional.

Note that the `typeof notNumber` before `new Buffer` is required (for cases when `notNumber` argument is not
hard-coded) and _is not caused by the deprecation of Buffer constructor_  it's exactly _why_ the
Buffer constructor is deprecated. Ecosystem packages lacking this type-check caused numereous
security issues  situations when unsanitized user input could end up in the `Buffer(arg)` create
problems ranging from DoS to leaking sensitive information to the attacker from the process memory.

When `notNumber` argument is hardcoded (e.g. literal `"abc"` or `[0,1,2]`), the `typeof` check can
be omitted.

Also note that using TypeScript does not fix this problem for you  when libs written in
`TypeScript` are used from JS, or when user input ends up there  it behaves exactly as pure JS, as
all type checks are translation-time only and are not present in the actual JS code which TS
compiles to.

### Buffer(number)

For Node.js 0.10.x (and below) support:

```js
var buf;
if (Buffer.alloc) {
  buf = Buffer.alloc(number);
} else {
  buf = new Buffer(number);
  buf.fill(0);
}
```

Otherwise (Node.js  0.12.x):

```js
const buf = Buffer.alloc ? Buffer.alloc(number) : new Buffer(number).fill(0);
```

## Regarding Buffer.allocUnsafe

Be extra cautious when using `Buffer.allocUnsafe`:
 * Don't use it if you don't have a good reason to
   * e.g. you probably won't ever see a performance difference for small buffers, in fact, those
     might be even faster with `Buffer.alloc()`,
   * if your code is not in the hot code path  you also probably won't notice a difference,
   * keep in mind that zero-filling minimizes the potential risks.
 * If you use it, make sure that you never return the buffer in a partially-filled state,
   * if you are writing to it sequentially  always truncate it to the actuall written length

Errors in handling buffers allocated with `Buffer.allocUnsafe` could result in various issues,
ranged from undefined behaviour of your code to sensitive data (user input, passwords, certs)
leaking to the remote attacker.

_Note that the same applies to `new Buffer` usage without zero-filling, depending on the Node.js
version (and lacking type checks also adds DoS to the list of potential problems)._

## FAQ

<a id="design-flaws"></a>
### What is wrong with the `Buffer` constructor?

The `Buffer` constructor could be used to create a buffer in many different ways:

- `new Buffer(42)` creates a `Buffer` of 42 bytes. Before Node.js 8, this buffer contained
  *arbitrary memory* for performance reasons, which could include anything ranging from
  program source code to passwords and encryption keys.
- `new Buffer('abc')` creates a `Buffer` that contains the UTF-8-encoded version of
  the string `'abc'`. A second argument could specify another encoding: For example,
  `new Buffer(string, 'base64')` could be used to convert a Base64 string into the original
  sequence of bytes that it represents.
- There are several other combinations of arguments.

This meant that, in code like `var buffer = new Buffer(foo);`, *it is not possible to tell
what exactly the contents of the generated buffer are* without knowing the type of `foo`.

Sometimes, the value of `foo` comes from an external source. For example, this function
could be exposed as a service on a web server, converting a UTF-8 string into its Base64 form:

```
function stringToBase64(req, res) {
  // The request body should have the format of `{ string: 'foobar' }`
  const rawBytes = new Buffer(req.body.string)
  const encoded = rawBytes.toString('base64')
  res.end({ encoded: encoded })
}
```

Note that this code does *not* validate the type of `req.body.string`:

- `req.body.string` is expected to be a string. If this is the case, all goes well.
- `req.body.string` is controlled by the client that sends the request.
- If `req.body.string` is the *number* `50`, the `rawBytes` would be 50 bytes:
  - Before Node.js 8, the content would be uninitialized
  - After Node.js 8, the content would be `50` bytes with the value `0`

Because of the missing type check, an attacker could intentionally send a number
as part of the request. Using this, they can either:

- Read uninitialized memory. This **will** leak passwords, encryption keys and other
  kinds of sensitive information. (Information leak)
- Force the program to allocate a large amount of memory. For example, when specifying
  `500000000` as the input value, each request will allocate 500MB of memory.
  This can be used to either exhaust the memory available of a program completely
  and make it crash, or slow it down significantly. (Denial of Service)

Both of these scenarios are considered serious security issues in a real-world
web server context.

when using `Buffer.from(req.body.string)` instead, passing a number will always
throw an exception instead, giving a controlled behaviour that can always be
handled by the program.

<a id="ecosystem-usage"></a>
### The `Buffer()` constructor has been deprecated for a while. Is this really an issue?

Surveys of code in the `npm` ecosystem have shown that the `Buffer()` constructor is still
widely used. This includes new code, and overall usage of such code has actually been
*increasing*.

Modern Buffer API polyfill without footguns, working on Node.js from 0.8 to current.

## How to use?

First, port all `Buffer()` and `new Buffer()` calls to `Buffer.alloc()` and `Buffer.from()` API.

Then, to achieve compatibility with outdated Node.js versions (`<4.5.0` and 5.x `<5.9.0`), use
`const Buffer = require('safer-buffer').Buffer` in all files where you make calls to the new
Buffer API. _Use `var` instead of `const` if you need that for your Node.js version range support._

Also, see the
[porting Buffer](https://github.com/ChALkeR/safer-buffer/blob/master/Porting-Buffer.md) guide.

## Do I need it?

Hopefully, not  dropping support for outdated Node.js versions should be fine nowdays, and that
is the recommended path forward. You _do_ need to port to the `Buffer.alloc()` and `Buffer.from()`
though.

See the [porting guide](https://github.com/ChALkeR/safer-buffer/blob/master/Porting-Buffer.md)
for a better description.

## Why not [safe-buffer](https://npmjs.com/safe-buffer)?

_In short: while `safe-buffer` serves as a polyfill for the new API, it allows old API usage and
itself contains footguns._

`safe-buffer` could be used safely to get the new API while still keeping support for older
Node.js versions (like this module), but while analyzing ecosystem usage of the old Buffer API
I found out that `safe-buffer` is itself causing problems in some cases.

For example, consider the following snippet:

```console
$ cat example.unsafe.js
console.log(Buffer(20))
$ ./node-v6.13.0-linux-x64/bin/node example.unsafe.js
<Buffer 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 13 de 02 00 00 00 00 05 00 00 00>
$ standard example.unsafe.js
standard: Use JavaScript Standard Style (https://standardjs.com)
  /home/chalker/repo/safer-buffer/example.unsafe.js:2:13: 'Buffer()' was deprecated since v6. Use 'Buffer.alloc()' or 'Buffer.from()' (use 'https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-buffer' for '<4.5.0') instead.
```

This is allocates and writes to console an uninitialized chunk of memory.
[standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard) linter (among others) catch that and warn people
to avoid using unsafe API.

Let's now throw in `safe-buffer`!

```console
$ cat example.safe-buffer.js
const Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer
console.log(Buffer(20))
$ standard example.safe-buffer.js
$ ./node-v6.13.0-linux-x64/bin/node example.safe-buffer.js
<Buffer 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 28 58 01 82 fe 7f 00 00 00 00 00 00>
```

See the problem? Adding in `safe-buffer` _magically removes the lint warning_, but the behavior
remains idential to what we had before, and when launched on Node.js 6.x LTS  this dumps out
chunks of uninitialized memory.
_And this code will still emit runtime warnings on Node.js 10.x and above._

That was done by design. I first considered changing `safe-buffer`, prohibiting old API usage or
emitting warnings on it, but that significantly diverges from `safe-buffer` design. After some
discussion, it was decided to move my approach into a separate package, and _this is that separate
package_.

This footgun is not imaginary  I observed top-downloaded packages doing that kind of thing,
fixing the lint warning by blindly including `safe-buffer` without any actual changes.

Also in some cases, even if the API _was_ migrated to use of safe Buffer API  a random pull request
can bring unsafe Buffer API usage back to the codebase by adding new calls  and that could go
unnoticed even if you have a linter prohibiting that (becase of the reason stated above), and even
pass CI. _I also observed that being done in popular packages._

Some examples:
 * [webdriverio](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/commit/05cbd3167c12e4930f09ef7cf93b127ba4effae4#diff-124380949022817b90b622871837d56cR31)
   (a module with 548 759 downloads/month),
 * [websocket-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/websocket-stream/commit/c9312bd24d08271687d76da0fe3c83493871cf61)
   (218 288 d/m, fix in [maxogden/websocket-stream#142](https://github.com/maxogden/websocket-stream/pull/142)),
 * [node-serialport](https://github.com/node-serialport/node-serialport/commit/e8d9d2b16c664224920ce1c895199b1ce2def48c)
   (113 138 d/m, fix in [node-serialport/node-serialport#1510](https://github.com/node-serialport/node-serialport/pull/1510)),
 * [karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/commit/3d94b8cf18c695104ca195334dc75ff054c74eec)
   (3 973 193 d/m, fix in [karma-runner/karma#2947](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/pull/2947)),
 * [spdy-transport](https://github.com/spdy-http2/spdy-transport/commit/5375ac33f4a62a4f65bcfc2827447d42a5dbe8b1)
   (5 970 727 d/m, fix in [spdy-http2/spdy-transport#53](https://github.com/spdy-http2/spdy-transport/pull/53)).
 * And there are a lot more over the ecosystem.

I filed a PR at
[mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node#110](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/pull/110) to
partially fix that (for cases when that lint rule is used), but it is a semver-major change for
linter rules and presets, so it would take significant time for that to reach actual setups.
_It also hasn't been released yet (2018-03-20)._

Also, `safer-buffer` discourages the usage of `.allocUnsafe()`, which is often done by a mistake.
It still supports it with an explicit concern barier, by placing it under
`require('safer-buffer/dangereous')`.

## But isn't throwing bad?

Not really. It's an error that could be noticed and fixed early, instead of causing havoc later like
unguarded `new Buffer()` calls that end up receiving user input can do.

This package affects only the files where `var Buffer = require('safer-buffer').Buffer` was done, so
it is really simple to keep track of things and make sure that you don't mix old API usage with that.
Also, CI should hint anything that you might have missed.

New commits, if tested, won't land new usage of unsafe Buffer API this way.
_Node.js 10.x also deals with that by printing a runtime depecation warning._

### Would it affect third-party modules?

No, unless you explicitly do an awful thing like monkey-patching or overriding the built-in `Buffer`.
Don't do that.

### But I don't want throwing

That is also fine!

Also, it could be better in some cases when you don't comprehensive enough test coverage.

In that case  just don't override `Buffer` and use
`var SaferBuffer = require('safer-buffer').Buffer` instead.

That way, everything using `Buffer` natively would still work, but there would be two drawbacks:

* `Buffer.from`/`Buffer.alloc` won't be polyfilled  use `SaferBuffer.from` and
  `SaferBuffer.alloc` instead.
* You are still open to accidentally using the insecure deprecated API  use a linter to catch that.

Note that using a linter to catch accidential `Buffer` constructor usage in this case is strongly
recommended. `Buffer` is not overriden in this usecase, so linters won't get confused.

## Without footguns?

Well, it is still possible to do _some_ things with `Buffer` API, e.g. accessing `.buffer` property
on older versions and duping things from there. You shouldn't do that in your code, probabably.

The intention is to remove the most significant footguns that affect lots of packages in the
ecosystem, and to do it in the proper way.

Also, this package doesn't protect against security issues affecting some Node.js versions, so for
usage in your own production code, it is still recommended to update to a Node.js version
[supported by upstream](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).

# WebIDL Type Conversions on JavaScript Values

This package implements, in JavaScript, the algorithms to convert a given JavaScript value according to a given [WebIDL](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/) [type](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-types).

The goal is that you should be able to write code like

```js
const conversions = require("webidl-conversions");

function doStuff(x, y) {
    x = conversions["boolean"](x);
    y = conversions["unsigned long"](y);
    // actual algorithm code here
}
```

and your function `doStuff` will behave the same as a WebIDL operation declared as

```webidl
void doStuff(boolean x, unsigned long y);
```

## API

This package's main module's default export is an object with a variety of methods, each corresponding to a different WebIDL type. Each method, when invoked on a JavaScript value, will give back the new JavaScript value that results after passing through the WebIDL conversion rules. (See below for more details on what that means.) Alternately, the method could throw an error, if the WebIDL algorithm is specified to do so: for example `conversions["float"](NaN)` [will throw a `TypeError`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-float).

## Status

All of the numeric types are implemented (float being implemented as double) and some others are as well - check the source for all of them. This list will grow over time in service of the [HTML as Custom Elements](https://github.com/dglazkov/html-as-custom-elements) project, but in the meantime, pull requests welcome!

I'm not sure yet what the strategy will be for modifiers, e.g. [`[Clamp]`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#Clamp). Maybe something like `conversions["unsigned long"](x, { clamp: true })`? We'll see.

We might also want to extend the API to give better error messages, e.g. "Argument 1 of HTMLMediaElement.fastSeek is not a finite floating-point value" instead of "Argument is not a finite floating-point value." This would require passing in more information to the conversion functions than we currently do.

## Background

What's actually going on here, conceptually, is pretty weird. Let's try to explain.

WebIDL, as part of its madness-inducing design, has its own type system. When people write algorithms in web platform specs, they usually operate on WebIDL values, i.e. instances of WebIDL types. For example, if they were specifying the algorithm for our `doStuff` operation above, they would treat `x` as a WebIDL value of [WebIDL type `boolean`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-boolean). Crucially, they would _not_ treat `x` as a JavaScript variable whose value is either the JavaScript `true` or `false`. They're instead working in a different type system altogether, with its own rules.

Separately from its type system, WebIDL defines a ["binding"](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#ecmascript-binding) of the type system into JavaScript. This contains rules like: when you pass a JavaScript value to the JavaScript method that manifests a given WebIDL operation, how does that get converted into a WebIDL value? For example, a JavaScript `true` passed in the position of a WebIDL `boolean` argument becomes a WebIDL `true`. But, a JavaScript `true` passed in the position of a [WebIDL `unsigned long`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-unsigned-long) becomes a WebIDL `1`. And so on.

Finally, we have the actual implementation code. This is usually C++, although these days [some smart people are using Rust](https://github.com/servo/servo). The implementation, of course, has its own type system. So when they implement the WebIDL algorithms, they don't actually use WebIDL values, since those aren't "real" outside of specs. Instead, implementations apply the WebIDL binding rules in such a way as to convert incoming JavaScript values into C++ values. For example, if code in the browser called `doStuff(true, true)`, then the implementation code would eventually receive a C++ `bool` containing `true` and a C++ `uint32_t` containing `1`.

The upside of all this is that implementations can abstract all the conversion logic away, letting WebIDL handle it, and focus on implementing the relevant methods in C++ with values of the correct type already provided. That is payoff of WebIDL, in a nutshell.

And getting to that payoff is the goal of _this_ projectbut for JavaScript implementations, instead of C++ ones. That is, this library is designed to make it easier for JavaScript developers to write functions that behave like a given WebIDL operation. So conceptually, the conversion pipeline, which in its general form is JavaScript values  WebIDL values  implementation-language values, in this case becomes JavaScript values  WebIDL values  JavaScript values. And that intermediate step is where all the logic is performed: a JavaScript `true` becomes a WebIDL `1` in an unsigned long context, which then becomes a JavaScript `1`.

## Don't Use This

Seriously, why would you ever use this? You really shouldn't. WebIDL is  not great, and you shouldn't be emulating its semantics. If you're looking for a generic argument-processing library, you should find one with better rules than those from WebIDL. In general, your JavaScript should not be trying to become more like WebIDL; if anything, we should fix WebIDL to make it more like JavaScript.

The _only_ people who should use this are those trying to create faithful implementations (or polyfills) of web platform interfaces defined in WebIDL.

# whatwg-url

whatwg-url is a full implementation of the WHATWG [URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/). It can be used standalone, but it also exposes a lot of the internal algorithms that are useful for integrating a URL parser into a project like [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).

## Current Status

whatwg-url is currently up to date with the URL spec up to commit [a62223](https://github.com/whatwg/url/commit/a622235308342c9adc7fc2fd1659ff059f7d5e2a).

## API

### The `URL` Constructor

The main API is the [`URL`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url) export, which follows the spec's behavior in all ways (including e.g. `USVString` conversion). Most consumers of this library will want to use this.

### Low-level URL Standard API

The following methods are exported for use by places like jsdom that need to implement things like [`HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#htmlhyperlinkelementutils). They operate on or return an "internal URL" or ["URL record"](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url) type.

- [URL parser](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-parser): `parseURL(input, { baseURL, encodingOverride })`
- [Basic URL parser](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser): `basicURLParse(input, { baseURL, encodingOverride, url, stateOverride })`
- [URL serializer](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-serializer): `serializeURL(urlRecord, excludeFragment)`
- [Host serializer](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-host-serializer): `serializeHost(hostFromURLRecord)`
- [Serialize an integer](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#serialize-an-integer): `serializeInteger(number)`
- [Origin](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-origin) [serializer](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#serialization-of-an-origin): `serializeURLOrigin(urlRecord)`
- [Set the username](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#set-the-username): `setTheUsername(urlRecord, usernameString)`
- [Set the password](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#set-the-password): `setThePassword(urlRecord, passwordString)`
- [Cannot have a username/password/port](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#cannot-have-a-username-password-port): `cannotHaveAUsernamePasswordPort(urlRecord)`

The `stateOverride` parameter is one of the following strings:

- [`"scheme start"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#scheme-start-state)
- [`"scheme"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#scheme-state)
- [`"no scheme"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#no-scheme-state)
- [`"special relative or authority"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#special-relative-or-authority-state)
- [`"path or authority"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#path-or-authority-state)
- [`"relative"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-state)
- [`"relative slash"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-slash-state)
- [`"special authority slashes"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#special-authority-slashes-state)
- [`"special authority ignore slashes"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#special-authority-ignore-slashes-state)
- [`"authority"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#authority-state)
- [`"host"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-state)
- [`"hostname"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#hostname-state)
- [`"port"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#port-state)
- [`"file"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#file-state)
- [`"file slash"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#file-slash-state)
- [`"file host"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#file-host-state)
- [`"path start"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#path-start-state)
- [`"path"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#path-state)
- [`"cannot-be-a-base-URL path"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#cannot-be-a-base-url-path-state)
- [`"query"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#query-state)
- [`"fragment"`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#fragment-state)

The URL record type has the following API:

- [`scheme`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-scheme)
- [`username`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-username)
- [`password`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-password)
- [`host`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host)
- [`port`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-port)
- [`path`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-path) (as an array)
- [`query`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-query)
- [`fragment`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-fragment)
- [`cannotBeABaseURL`](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-cannot-be-a-base-url-flag) (as a boolean)

These properties should be treated with care, as in general changing them will cause the URL record to be in an inconsistent state until the appropriate invocation of `basicURLParse` is used to fix it up. You can see examples of this in the URL Standard, where there are many step sequences like "4. Set context objects urls fragment to the empty string. 5. Basic URL parse _input_ with context objects url as _url_ and fragment state as _state override_." In between those two steps, a URL record is in an unusable state.

The return value of "failure" in the spec is represented by the string `"failure"`. That is, functions like `parseURL` and `basicURLParse` can return _either_ a URL record _or_ the string `"failure"`.

[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/websockets/ws/ci.yml?branch=master&label=CI&logo=github)](https://github.com/websockets/ws/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/websockets/ws/master.svg?logo=coveralls)](https://coveralls.io/github/websockets/ws)

ws is a simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and
server implementation.

Passes the quite extensive Autobahn test suite: [server][server-report],
[client][client-report].

**Note**: This module does not work in the browser. The client in the docs is a
reference to a backend with the role of a client in the WebSocket communication.
Browser clients must use the native
[`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
object. To make the same code work seamlessly on Node.js and the browser, you
can use one of the many wrappers available on npm, like
[isomorphic-ws](https://github.com/heineiuo/isomorphic-ws).

## Protocol support

- **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`)
- **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option
  `protocolVersion: 13`)

## Installing

```
npm install ws
```

### Opt-in for performance

[bufferutil][] is an optional module that can be installed alongside the ws
module:

```
npm install --save-optional bufferutil
```

This is a binary addon that improves the performance of certain operations such
as masking and unmasking the data payload of the WebSocket frames. Prebuilt
binaries are available for the most popular platforms, so you don't necessarily
need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine.

To force ws to not use bufferutil, use the
[`WS_NO_BUFFER_UTIL`](./doc/ws.md#ws_no_buffer_util) environment variable. This
can be useful to enhance security in systems where a user can put a package in
the package search path of an application of another user, due to how the
Node.js resolver algorithm works.

#### Legacy opt-in for performance

If you are running on an old version of Node.js (prior to v18.14.0), ws also
supports the [utf-8-validate][] module:

```
npm install --save-optional utf-8-validate
```

This contains a binary polyfill for [`buffer.isUtf8()`][].

To force ws not to use utf-8-validate, use the
[`WS_NO_UTF_8_VALIDATE`](./doc/ws.md#ws_no_utf_8_validate) environment variable.

## API docs

See [`/doc/ws.md`](./doc/ws.md) for Node.js-like documentation of ws classes and
utility functions.

## WebSocket compression

ws supports the [permessage-deflate extension][permessage-deflate] which enables
the client and server to negotiate a compression algorithm and its parameters,
and then selectively apply it to the data payloads of each WebSocket message.

The extension is disabled by default on the server and enabled by default on the
client. It adds a significant overhead in terms of performance and memory
consumption so we suggest to enable it only if it is really needed.

Note that Node.js has a variety of issues with high-performance compression,
where increased concurrency, especially on Linux, can lead to [catastrophic
memory fragmentation][node-zlib-bug] and slow performance. If you intend to use
permessage-deflate in production, it is worthwhile to set up a test
representative of your workload and ensure Node.js/zlib will handle it with
acceptable performance and memory usage.

Tuning of permessage-deflate can be done via the options defined below. You can
also use `zlibDeflateOptions` and `zlibInflateOptions`, which is passed directly
into the creation of [raw deflate/inflate streams][node-zlib-deflaterawdocs].

See [the docs][ws-server-options] for more options.

```js
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({
  port: 8080,
  perMessageDeflate: {
    zlibDeflateOptions: {
      // See zlib defaults.
      chunkSize: 1024,
      memLevel: 7,
      level: 3
    },
    zlibInflateOptions: {
      chunkSize: 10 * 1024
    },
    // Other options settable:
    clientNoContextTakeover: true, // Defaults to negotiated value.
    serverNoContextTakeover: true, // Defaults to negotiated value.
    serverMaxWindowBits: 10, // Defaults to negotiated value.
    // Below options specified as default values.
    concurrencyLimit: 10, // Limits zlib concurrency for perf.
    threshold: 1024 // Size (in bytes) below which messages
    // should not be compressed if context takeover is disabled.
  }
});
```

The client will only use the extension if it is supported and enabled on the
server. To always disable the extension on the client, set the
`perMessageDeflate` option to `false`.

```js
import WebSocket from 'ws';

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path', {
  perMessageDeflate: false
});
```

## Usage examples

### Sending and receiving text data

```js
import WebSocket from 'ws';

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');

ws.on('error', console.error);

ws.on('open', function open() {
  ws.send('something');
});

ws.on('message', function message(data) {
  console.log('received: %s', data);
});
```

### Sending binary data

```js
import WebSocket from 'ws';

const ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');

ws.on('error', console.error);

ws.on('open', function open() {
  const array = new Float32Array(5);

  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
    array[i] = i / 2;
  }

  ws.send(array);
});
```

### Simple server

```js
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('error', console.error);

  ws.on('message', function message(data) {
    console.log('received: %s', data);
  });

  ws.send('something');
});
```

### External HTTP/S server

```js
import { createServer } from 'https';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const server = createServer({
  cert: readFileSync('/path/to/cert.pem'),
  key: readFileSync('/path/to/key.pem')
});
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ server });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('error', console.error);

  ws.on('message', function message(data) {
    console.log('received: %s', data);
  });

  ws.send('something');
});

server.listen(8080);
```

### Multiple servers sharing a single HTTP/S server

```js
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const server = createServer();
const wss1 = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });
const wss2 = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });

wss1.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('error', console.error);

  // ...
});

wss2.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('error', console.error);

  // ...
});

server.on('upgrade', function upgrade(request, socket, head) {
  const { pathname } = new URL(request.url, 'wss://base.url');

  if (pathname === '/foo') {
    wss1.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, function done(ws) {
      wss1.emit('connection', ws, request);
    });
  } else if (pathname === '/bar') {
    wss2.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, function done(ws) {
      wss2.emit('connection', ws, request);
    });
  } else {
    socket.destroy();
  }
});

server.listen(8080);
```

### Client authentication

```js
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

function onSocketError(err) {
  console.error(err);
}

const server = createServer();
const wss = new WebSocketServer({ noServer: true });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws, request, client) {
  ws.on('error', console.error);

  ws.on('message', function message(data) {
    console.log(`Received message ${data} from user ${client}`);
  });
});

server.on('upgrade', function upgrade(request, socket, head) {
  socket.on('error', onSocketError);

  // This function is not defined on purpose. Implement it with your own logic.
  authenticate(request, function next(err, client) {
    if (err || !client) {
      socket.write('HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\n\r\n');
      socket.destroy();
      return;
    }

    socket.removeListener('error', onSocketError);

    wss.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, function done(ws) {
      wss.emit('connection', ws, request, client);
    });
  });
});

server.listen(8080);
```

Also see the provided [example][session-parse-example] using `express-session`.

### Server broadcast

A client WebSocket broadcasting to all connected WebSocket clients, including
itself.

```js
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('error', console.error);

  ws.on('message', function message(data, isBinary) {
    wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(data, { binary: isBinary });
      }
    });
  });
});
```

A client WebSocket broadcasting to every other connected WebSocket clients,
excluding itself.

```js
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.on('error', console.error);

  ws.on('message', function message(data, isBinary) {
    wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {
      if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(data, { binary: isBinary });
      }
    });
  });
});
```

### Round-trip time

```js
import WebSocket from 'ws';

const ws = new WebSocket('wss://websocket-echo.com/');

ws.on('error', console.error);

ws.on('open', function open() {
  console.log('connected');
  ws.send(Date.now());
});

ws.on('close', function close() {
  console.log('disconnected');
});

ws.on('message', function message(data) {
  console.log(`Round-trip time: ${Date.now() - data} ms`);

  setTimeout(function timeout() {
    ws.send(Date.now());
  }, 500);
});
```

### Use the Node.js streams API

```js
import WebSocket, { createWebSocketStream } from 'ws';

const ws = new WebSocket('wss://websocket-echo.com/');

const duplex = createWebSocketStream(ws, { encoding: 'utf8' });

duplex.on('error', console.error);

duplex.pipe(process.stdout);
process.stdin.pipe(duplex);
```

### Other examples

For a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the
examples folder.

Otherwise, see the test cases.

## FAQ

### How to get the IP address of the client?

The remote IP address can be obtained from the raw socket.

```js
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws, req) {
  const ip = req.socket.remoteAddress;

  ws.on('error', console.error);
});
```

When the server runs behind a proxy like NGINX, the de-facto standard is to use
the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

```js
wss.on('connection', function connection(ws, req) {
  const ip = req.headers['x-forwarded-for'].split(',')[0].trim();

  ws.on('error', console.error);
});
```

### How to detect and close broken connections?

Sometimes, the link between the server and the client can be interrupted in a
way that keeps both the server and the client unaware of the broken state of the
connection (e.g. when pulling the cord).

In these cases, ping messages can be used as a means to verify that the remote
endpoint is still responsive.

```js
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

function heartbeat() {
  this.isAlive = true;
}

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  ws.isAlive = true;
  ws.on('error', console.error);
  ws.on('pong', heartbeat);
});

const interval = setInterval(function ping() {
  wss.clients.forEach(function each(ws) {
    if (ws.isAlive === false) return ws.terminate();

    ws.isAlive = false;
    ws.ping();
  });
}, 30000);

wss.on('close', function close() {
  clearInterval(interval);
});
```

Pong messages are automatically sent in response to ping messages as required by
the spec.

Just like the server example above, your clients might as well lose connection
without knowing it. You might want to add a ping listener on your clients to
prevent that. A simple implementation would be:

```js
import WebSocket from 'ws';

function heartbeat() {
  clearTimeout(this.pingTimeout);

  // Use `WebSocket#terminate()`, which immediately destroys the connection,
  // instead of `WebSocket#close()`, which waits for the close timer.
  // Delay should be equal to the interval at which your server
  // sends out pings plus a conservative assumption of the latency.
  this.pingTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    this.terminate();
  }, 30000 + 1000);
}

const client = new WebSocket('wss://websocket-echo.com/');

client.on('error', console.error);
client.on('open', heartbeat);
client.on('ping', heartbeat);
client.on('close', function clear() {
  clearTimeout(this.pingTimeout);
});
```

### How to connect via a proxy?

Use a custom `http.Agent` implementation like [https-proxy-agent][] or
[socks-proxy-agent][].

File: ./node_modules/xmlhttprequest/README.md
# node-XMLHttpRequest #

node-XMLHttpRequest is a wrapper for the built-in http client to emulate the
browser XMLHttpRequest object.

This can be used with JS designed for browsers to improve reuse of code and
allow the use of existing libraries.

Note: This library currently conforms to [XMLHttpRequest 1](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/). Version 2.0 will target [XMLHttpRequest Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/).

## Usage ##

Here's how to include the module in your project and use as the browser-based
XHR object.

	var XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;
	var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

Note: use the lowercase string "xmlhttprequest" in your require(). On
case-sensitive systems (eg Linux) using uppercase letters won't work.

## Versions ##

Prior to 1.4.0 version numbers were arbitrary. From 1.4.0 on they conform to
the standard major.minor.bugfix. 1.x shouldn't necessarily be considered
stable just because it's above 0.x.

Since the XMLHttpRequest API is stable this library's API is stable as
well. Major version numbers indicate significant core code changes.
Minor versions indicate minor core code changes or better conformity to
the W3C spec.

## License ##

MIT license. See LICENSE for full details.

## Supports ##

* Async and synchronous requests
* GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
* All spec methods (open, send, abort, getRequestHeader,
  getAllRequestHeaders, event methods)
* Requests to all domains

## Known Issues / Missing Features ##

For a list of open issues or to report your own visit the [github issues
page](https://github.com/driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest/issues).

* Local file access may have unexpected results for non-UTF8 files
* Synchronous requests don't set headers properly
* Synchronous requests freeze node while waiting for response (But that's what you want, right? Stick with async!).
* Some events are missing, such as abort
* Cookies aren't persisted between requests
* Missing XML support

forked from dvopalecky/gen-mapper
# disciple-mapper
App for mapping generations of reproducible disciples.

## Usage
The app can be found [here]().
For details about usage click the Help button (?) in the app.

There are several variants of the App, e.g. [Four Fields](https://dvopalecky.github.io/gen-mapper/four-fields/index.html) or [Church Circles](https://dvopalecky.github.io/gen-mapper/church-circles/index.html).
These variants use templates so it's relatively easy to create a new variant for specific purpose.

Currently the App use only front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
It can be also run offline. Downside is that the work must be stored in local .csv files.
Backend support, i.e. saving work on the server, sharing etc. might be added later.

## Example
![gen-mapper example](https://dvopalecky.github.io/gen-mapper/gen-mapper-example1.png)

## Changelog
see [here](changelog.md)

## Known issues
* Safari - not displaying some icons
* Edge/Internet Explorer - wrong display of map

## Ideas for improvements
* Backend support: Saving work on server, sharing, etc.
* Differentiate Between a reaper who didn't disciple the new convert with a red colored disciple (not discipled)
* To address the issues you've highlighted with managing and tracking both discipleship and reaping relationships within the disciple mapper, here's a refined approach to enhancing the tool's functionality:

### Enhanced Data Model

To allow for a more nuanced tracking of discipleship relationships and the initial reaping, the data structure can be modified to include the following fields for each disciple:

1. **Discipled By**: Replaces the current 'Parent' dropdown. This field records the current discipler of the individual. The goal is to disciple new converts and so this is the most important part once a new disciple is added to the disciple map. They should be assigned a disciple maker who can disciple them in reproducible discipleship. We hope to use this app to decrease new convert orphans who are reaped and never discipled. 

2. **Reaped By**: A new entry in the menu that denotes who led the disciple to the Lord. This maintains the connection to the original reaper even if discipleship is reassigned.

3. **Is Discipleship Active (1 or 0)**: Indicates whether discipleship is ongoing (1) or has stopped (0). When discipleship stops (0), the disciple's cell or row could turn red as a visual cue for intervention or follow-up.

By adding these fields, the tool can maintain a clear record of both who led a person to Christ (reaping) and who is currently discipling them, even if these roles shift over time. This dual tracking helps maintain a fuller picture of each disciple's spiritual journey.

### Implementing the Changes

1. **Update User Interface**: Adjust the tool's UI to include the new fields. Use clear labeling and tooltips to guide users on the purpose of each field and how to use them accurately.

2. **Visual Cues for Active/Inactive Discipleship**: Implement color-coding or icons next to disciples to indicate the status of their discipleship. This visual indication can help leaders quickly identify areas of the network that may need attention.

3. **Maintain Historical Data**: When the "Discipled By" field changes, ensure the historical data is preserved. One approach is creating a log or a separate section that records past discipleship relationships, ensuring that the history is not lost when reassignments happen.

4. **Training and Documentation**: Offer clear guidance and training materials for users on how to understand and utilize these new fields. Documentation can include best practices on managing discipleship transitions and monitoring the health of the disciple-making network.

### Advanced Functionality (Optional)

For an even more detailed tracking system:

- **Automatic Alerts or Reports**: Generate automatic alerts or reports for leaders when discipleship activities halt (i.e., when the "Is Discipleship Active" flag is set to 0). This proactive feature can help in timely interventions.

- **Visual Mapping Enhancements**: For visual mapping, consider allowing links or arrows from each disciple to both their "Reaped By" and "Discipled By" individuals. This could visually represent both relationships simultaneously, though it may require a sophisticated design to avoid clutter.

- **Analytics Dashboard**: A dashboard that aggregates data on discipleship effectiveness, highlighting areas of strength and concern within the network. Metrics could include the number of active vs. inactive discipleship relationships, reaping without follow-up, and trends over time.

### Conclusion

By revising the disciple mapper tool to separate and clearly track the roles of reaping and discipling, along with the active status of each discipleship relationship, leaders can gain deeper insights into the health of their disciple-making efforts. These enhancements not only improve operational functionality but also foster a more accountable and effective discipleship network.
