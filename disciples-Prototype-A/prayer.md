add the ability to pray for disciples into the app. you can type out prayers in the offline version, and then you can record prayers in the app version. 


You can pray for the network as a whole. add notes to it, select different branches. There needs to be a more complex database. Each branch should be kept. You should be able to click on the first generation of a stream and the ID's of the subsequent disciple generations should be mapped to the first gen. For example if there is branch 1.1

1 meaning gen 1
1."1" meaning branch 1 from the "1".1 main branch. The problem with this is, what about when a first generation disciple disciples another first generation disciple. It wouldn't be another generation, but would still be a branch. 1.1.1 1.2.1
1.1.1 a first gen discipling the first first gen disciple. 
1.2.1 a first gen discipling a second gen who is the first second gen to be discipled. 1.2.1
1 First Gen disciple maker
2 gen placeholder (second)
1 first second gen disciple

1.2.1 1.2.2 1.2.3 1.2.4 
1 first gen disciple maker

Lord I am stressed. i know that you desire that I would follow you. I see that you are asking me to love you, and remain in your love, to love others and be loved by others, and to make disciples and to be discipled. I see this as something you desire. I often get stuck in my head. I am desiring LORD that there would be a movement of disciple makers who meet the qualifications above and are walking in a love relationship with you, others, and are making disciples. I need your help to do this. I need your hlep to launch any movements. I see it is your desire to see this happen in my lifetime. There are many people who will be saved, but the world needs to know you. They need to be reached in a way that sustains the gospel presence among the UPG's until all the UPG's are no longer Unreached. There will be a mighty shaking of the church and awakening of every simple church and small legacy church to the calling to reach the UPG's with the knowledge of the Glory of the LORD. I feel called to send out mail to all the churches in the United States of America. I would like to figure out how to do this and get funding so that every church could receive vision casting for the 1040 window and for their neighbors. I need your help to do this, and I trust that you will help me to do this. There is a mighty shaking that will happen across the west to wake up to the missional call to reach the UPGs with the gospel of JEsus Christ. May my life be an offering to you that is poured out like gasoline on the fire that is burning to see the nations reached for the LOVE of GOD to be satisfied with worshippers who are known and make him known publically. May we follow you until the day we die.
