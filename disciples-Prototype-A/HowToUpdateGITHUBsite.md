# Updating GitHub Pages

This tutorial will guide you through the process of updating your GitHub Pages site using the `gh-pages` branch.

## Step 1: Stage your changes

The first step is to stage the changes you've made. This prepares them for the next commit. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

    git add .

This command stages all the changes you've made in the project.

Step 2: Commit your changes
After staging your changes, you need to commit them. This saves a snapshot of your changes to the project history. Run the following command:"

    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

Replace "Your descriptive commit message" with a brief description of the changes you've made.

Step 3: Push your changes to the gh-pages branch
Now that your changes are committed, you can push them to the gh-pages branch on GitHub. Run the following command:

    git push origin gh-pages

This command pushes your changes to the gh-pages branch of the remote repository named origin.

After running these commands, your changes should be live on your GitHub Pages site. Remember, it may take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to process the changes and update the live site.

Remember to replace "Your descriptive commit message" with a brief description of the changes you've made when you commit your changes.
