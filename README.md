# gen-mapper
App for mapping generations of simple churches. This app is not maintained anymore.

## Usage
The app can be found [here](https://dvopalecky.github.io/gen-mapper).
For details about usage click the Help button (?) in the app.

There are several variants of the App, e.g. [Four Fields](https://dvopalecky.github.io/gen-mapper/four-fields/index.html) or [Church Circles](https://dvopalecky.github.io/gen-mapper/church-circles/index.html).
These variants use templates so it's relatively easy to create a new variant for specific purpose.

Currently the App use only front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
It can be also run offline. Downside is that the work must be stored in local .csv files.
Backend support, i.e. saving work on the server, sharing etc. might be added later.
