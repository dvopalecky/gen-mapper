There was a time in my life where I really struggled with having terrible thoughts, and I was walking in sexual sin almost daily. I was once too far from GOD. I was walking away from him. I hated myself, and had self harm thoughts and actions. I was truly broken. I was like a man who didn't know God and was going to spend the rest of my life doing what I would like to do never acknowledging God, but this is not the case. I learned about Jesus who could forgive me from my terrible actions, and give me a better life. I wanted the new life that I knew that Jesus could provide for me. In my pursuit of him I was filled with the Holy Spirit after believing that Jesus rose again from the dead and my life was changed. I am now freed from the sexual sin I used to walk in and I no longer cut myself or have suicidal plans. I have a reason to live and that is love. God is love, and he has given me a love for myself and a love for others. JESUS.
