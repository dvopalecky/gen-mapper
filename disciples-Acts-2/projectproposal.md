1. Prepare a proposal for one of the following suggestions:

Create a new website for a business owner who runs various operations. The owner has three main parts of the website that each have their own requirements. The business owner recommends a specific tech stack that is not required but definitely recommended for ease of creation in budget and in time limitations. The first part of 3 of the app is due in 1 week, and there is already existing computer programming code for the first part of the app so the project manager isnâ€™t required to use alot of time for that. The second main part of the website app has existing code and is required 1 week after the first main part is finished, and the third main part of the app is due in at least 1 year. The website app in itself is a pilot project for the business owner and is requesting the project manager to help make the code. If the project manager does a good job he will be offered to have partial ownership and future benefits from the website app that is created. 

Proposal should include the following:

## Statement of customers need. ##
The customer's need is multifacetted. They need a website. They need a project manager to help direct a team of programmers to create the website. The website has three main parts. 
1. Part one is called oikos which helps the user map out the people they are mentoring. 
2. Part two is called communities which helps the user map out the communities they equip. 
3. Part three is called zipmapper which helps the user map out the zipcodes, regions, and pins.

They have quite a fast time budget on the part one and two. There already is existing code for part 1 and two, but not much at all for part three. Part 1 and 2 are projects where the project manager and programers are responsible for taking existing code that the owner has access to and custom tailoring it based on the owner's requirements. Project 1 is due in 1 week upon the project proposal's approval. Project 2 is due in 1 week after project 1 (even if project 1 is delayed). Project 3 is less high in demand and is due in 1 year. The customer mentioned that they will have another project manager do the project, but I must offer them a project proposal as a screening to to confirm or deny my work provided to them.

Project Proposal

Title: Development of a Three-Part Website Application for Business Operations

Statement of Customer Need: The customer requires a website application with three main parts: Oikos, Communities, and Zipmapper. Each part has unique functionalities to aid in their business operations. They also require a project manager to guide a team of programmers in creating this website. The customer may decide for someone else to write the code for part three, that will be another project manager that will work on addng part three to the website. 

Assumptions (Organized by category):

Techstack
    The customer has a recommended tech stack for the project.
    The customer's website is written in Javascript, css, html
    The customer will require the project manager to pay for and provide his own services for building the website. 
Pay after completion
    The customer won't pay the project manager or the programmers before the project is delivered, they have to do the work first and then get paid afterwards so the project manager should make sure to plan for programmer salaries out of pocket and get paid back for this by the completion payments.\
Existing Code for Website 
    The customer will provide the existing code to be used for the website instead of having to create brand new code from the ground up. 
    The existing code for parts one and two can be adapted to meet the customer's requirements.
Not all work is promised to project manager within the needs.
    The customer is open to a different project manager handling the third part of the project.


Project Scope: Create a website that combines three apps into one website. The three apps are, , and . The first app must allow for the user to use the exisitng code to add the people they are mentoring, when the user clicks on a person they are mentoring it opens a menu and allows the user to store specific data per person they are mentoring and it allows for the main menu where you can see all the poeple you are mentoring to be displayed in a tree view where you can see all the people zoom in and out and click on the shape that represents each person and clicking on a shape will allow for the user to display the data for that person. You can store name, address, phone number, and next steps for each person in a tree view from top down where your name shows up and you can keep notes for yourself as well, but notes for them. This is called oikos. 
    The next part of the website is called communities and it works similar to oikos but instead of people you are mentoring, it says communities. This lets you map out communities that you are training. You can train communities this way to grow and thrive with custom menus for each communitiy so that you can see which communities you are mentoring. This app has a special requirement. It requires a custom node box called team and the team will have the communities underneath it in a tree view that the team is aiming to equip. You can add a new team and you can add communities underneath that team. Each team comes from a community so this will let you map communities, and who is training which community. It also stores the communities in this tree in a map format and allows you to click on a box and open a menu and name the community, date, address, list of people etc. The scope could be more narrow, but it is exactly the oikos app, but instead of mapping people you're mentoring, youre mapping communities you are training. 
        Finally part three is zip mapper. this will be an app that will basically be an google my maps clone. It will let you have access to a map with layers. There will be a layer called county which will allow you to have county layers on the map, zipcodes which will allow you to add zipcodes on the map, and you can hand draw regions and add custom pins. This map should be able for teams to access. The map is customizable. You can import an excel sheet and it will add pins to the map that have the location tab, and it should have an excel sheet viewer that will let you view the database and edit it realtime that will update the map real time. You should be able to see in the excel sheet the names that are red if they don't have a location assigned to them, and see the names that arent red if they are showing up on the map. Zip mapper will allow you to see where the people are that you are mentoring, and where the communities are that you are training using community mapper. This third part of the website integrates with the first and second parts of the website. This will allow the user to view the mentor mapper people on the map and see which associated communities they are investing in. Not everyone you mentor will invest in impacting a community so this is why the website has three parts. The mentor mapper has more names, they can be displayed on zipmapper per zipcode. The community mapper can display which communities those you are mentoring are investing in. 


Deliverables:

A fully functional website application with three main parts.
Documentation of the development process and final product.
Training materials for users and administrators.
Resources:

Project Manager - Me
    Team of Programmers - Me and 1 other. 
    Existing code for parts one and two - access through customer. 
    Techstack Resources required for building the website:
        Supabase: For database and user signup and sign in. 
        Github: for existing code, and new changes
        Vercel: for hosting the code in a website 
        Namecheap: the domain name provider for the website


    

Schedule:
    Day 1 upon approval of the project, the project manager and the programmers are expected to start the project using their desired project management approach as long as it gets the following schedule requirements done on time seen below:

        Part one: Due in 1 week from project proposal approval.
                    Expected due date: May 17, 2024
        Part two: Due in 1 week after part one's completion.
                    Expected due date: May 24, 2024
        Part three: Due in 1 year.
                    Expected due date: May 24, 2025 (1 year)

Price: The estimated cost of the project is $40 per month in resources bought for building the app (Supabase, and Vercel), and a yearly cost of $25 upon first purchase for the domain name which will renew in 2025 for $25 a year starting in 5/10/2025. This includes development, project management costs, and potential future maintenance.

Risks:
    Techstack
        1. Technical difficulties in any of the required resources. 
        2. Learning curve for any new technologies that the programmers end up not being able to overcome. 
        3. Sudden price surges as unforseen costs rise upon needs for new resources to make the app work that cost more than budgetted. 
    Scope Changes
        4. Customer isn't happy with the way it's going and changes the scope. 
    Off Schedule
        5. Our team doesn't get the project done on schedule and is delayed and in danger of losing the project approval. 
    Security Risks
        6. App ends up not being secure and causes users info to be at risk of hackers.
Risk mitigation plan:
    Techstack
        1. Have a stakeholder chart of subject matter experts to reference in times of need, especially on stallations. Have a clear plan of action on how to communicate with the techstack resource providers including customer support, and access to their documentation put in our project management team's website. The project manager creating a custom team website to keep the how-to videos, and project information well organized so the team can know what resources are available if they get stuck on a project and need advice. 
        2. Having access to subject matter experts and making sure we keep a log of their contacts, and our previous converstaions. This is an ongoing risk mitigation plan that starts in the initiation and planning phase of the project. The project manager needs to keep a list of subject matter experts as key stakeholders for the project and use an excel sheet to track their vested interest in the project, and how well our relationship is with each of the stakeholders to ensure that we do good stakeholder relationship management and communication with the key SM Experts (SME). 
        2.1. Having tutorials for each of the applications and technologies ready. Any useful videos that any of the team members have found for hard problems using any of the techstack resources, make a space on the team website to paste useful video links so that each team member can be well informed on the useful tutorials and have a quick reference location. This will allow unversed team members to have access to videos that destroy knowledge barriers and allow programmers to more quickly code. One downside and risk to this is that if we spend too much time on these videos in our 1 week due date we can actually be late because of studying. The videos should be accessed and used in that quick reference videos tab on that website if there is a case where a team member runs into a hard problem and can't move forward. This location serves as a place for each team member to store resources they found most useful on the project. 
        3. Plan to discourage sudden rises in prices is to encourage team members to stick with the tech stack even if there seems to be another solution that is easier and cheaper. This requires the project manager to be ontop of the team members status on their progress. If someone is stuck and is considering changing the tech stack that could take time and money in new resources that seem easier but are delaying the team if the existing tech stack can make it work. The plan in this case is to feed the team members the right videos and training resources to use the existing resources we are paying for instead of allowing them to go use other resources if the existing ones can get the job done. This requires clear communication to each team member about the expectations that we will not be changing the techstack under many conditions at all and that new tech stack solutions require for active communication. We can use technologies on the teams website to allow each member to store their techstack using a website like techstack.io so that the project manager can see which resources each user is using, and which ones he needs to pay money for to allow the programmers to do their job. The techstack viewer will allow the team to stick to one set of solutions and give accountability. 
    Scope changes
        4. To ensure the customer isn't happy and changes scope. Our communication plan with the customer is to let them know what we are doing daily so there is no misunderstanding on our progress. They can clearly know where we are at in our progress. This is the agile project management stand up meetings where we plan on discussing with the team our progress each day, and the customer is always welcome to join in on our stand up meetings. These serve to update the customer our progress and allow them to communicate to us if there is a change. In this approach a delay in progress will not be a surprise because the customer will be able to see our progress daily and communicate with us if we are behind.

Delays in development phases.
Unforeseen technical issues.
Potential need for additional resources for part three.
Expected Benefits:

Improved business operations through the new website application.
Potential for partial ownership and future benefits for the project manager.
Project Management Approach:

As the project manager, I would employ a collaborative decision-making process, involving all key stakeholders to ensure that all perspectives are considered. Regular meetings will be held to discuss progress, address issues, and make necessary decisions.

The project schedule will be closely monitored and updated as necessary. Any potential delays will be addressed promptly to mitigate impact on the overall timeline.

In case of problems, a systematic problem-solving approach will be used. This includes identifying the problem, analyzing possible causes, developing and implementing solutions, and reviewing the effectiveness of the solution.

Stakeholders will be kept informed throughout the project. Regular updates will be provided, and their feedback will be sought to ensure the project meets their expectations and needs.
