1. Prepare a proposal for one of the following suggestions:

Create a new website for a business owner who runs various operations. The owner has three main parts of the website that each have their own requirements. The business owner recommends a specific tech stack that is not required but definitely recommended for ease of creation in budget and in time limitations. The first part of 3 of the app is due in 1 week, and there is already existing computer programming code for the first part of the app so the project manager isnâ€™t required to use alot of time for that. The second main part of the website app has existing code and is required 1 week after the first main part is finished, and the third main part of the app is due in at least 1 year. The website app in itself is a pilot project for the business owner and is requesting the project manager to help make the code. If the project manager does a good job he will be offered to have partial ownership and future benefits from the website app that is created. 

Proposal should include the following:
